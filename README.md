# Digital prevention services design history

A place for services within digital prevention services to document their design decisions and research learnings.

## Installation and getting started

1. Clone the repo to a folder on your computer
2. In your terminal, `cd` to the folder
3. Run `npm install` to install pre-requisites
4. Run `npm start` to build the design history site and serve it
5. View the site locally at `localhost:8080`

## Adding a new service

To add a new service, there is some set up involved.

You will need to create some files and folders based on the name of your service, using lowercase and hyphens. For example `your-service-name`.

You’ll need to:

- create a Markdown file in `app/posts/`, for example `app/posts/your-service-name.md`. Copy an existing example and update any references to match your service.
- create a folder for your service in `app/images/`, for example `app/images/your-service-name/`
- create a folder for your service in `app/posts/`, for example `app/posts/your-service-name/`
- inside your service’s post folder, create a JSON file `your-service-name.json`, for example `app/posts/your-service-name/your-service-name.json`. Copy an existing example for what to put in it.
- update `eleventy.config.js` to create a new ‘collection’ for your service (copy one of the existing examples)
- update `app/_layouts/_product.njk` to list your new service in the sections variable
- open a pull request with your changes

See [Divide a design history into different sections](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-design-history/divide-a-design-history-into-sections/).

## Adding a new post

You have two choices for adding a post:

- [Add a post manually](#add-a-post-manually)
- [Use the post generation scripts](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-design-history/generate-a-page-of-screenshots/)

### Add a post manually

1. Draft your design history post - it’s often easiest to do this in SharePoint
2. Create a new markdown file in `app/posts/[service-name]/YYYY/MM/[post-name].md`

   > It’s often easier to duplicate an existing post as that will have the headers you need

3. Edit the post with your content - make sure it has a title, subtitle, and date
4. If you have images, add them to a folder in `app/images/[service-name]/YYYY/MM/[post-name]/`
5. Make a pull request with your changes and get it reviewed

### Add a post using the generation scripts

[View more details on the scripts here.](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-design-history/generate-a-page-of-screenshots/)

1. Use a PNG optimiser [like TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to reduce the file size of your images.
2. Create a folder for your images and put them in `app/images/[service-name]/YYYY/MM/[post-name]/`
3. From the terminal, run `node scripts/generate.js [path]` where `path` is the full path to the folder of images. The easiest way to do this is to type `node scripts/generate.js` and then drag the folder from Finder on to your terminal to fill in the path.
4. The script will generate a new post linking to each image and place it in `app/posts/[service-name]/YYYY/MM/[post-name].md`.
5. You should check the title text for each image and amend as needed.
6. The script will prepend the post filename with the current date but you can delete this if you like.

## Deploying and publishing

Once you have a post you want to publish, make a pull request on this repo with your suggested change.

Once it is merged the updated design history will automatically deploy with your post.
