## Manage vaccinations in schools

We chose a polar bear as the team’s mascot because:

* they’re big on protecting cubs
* they live in hostile environments
* they’re highly adaptive
* they’re great at conserving energy

That, and everyone on the team seems to love [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/).
