This is the first post in a 3-part series about our approach to designing questions asking participants about their smoking history.  

We are designing a new digital service for the lung cancer screening programme. The service will ask eligible participants questions about their medical history and lifestyle to work out their risk of getting lung cancer in the next 5 years. If a participant is considered at higher risk of lung cancer they will be offered a CT scan. This service is currently delivered by phone and is called the [lung health check](https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/lung-cancer-screening/). We are exploring whether a digital offering would be desirable to users and clinically safe.  

## Asking participants about their smoking history 

Part of the questionnaire for the lung health check asks users about their history of smoking tobacco.  In the current phone service participants can give any additional information they think is relevant, whilst the call handler only records what they need for the calculation. This isn't something we'll be able to do in our digital service. We wrote about this briefly in a [previous design history](https://design-history.prevention-services.nhs.uk/lung-health-check/2025/08/lung-health-check-prototype/).  

Some of the other questions in the calculation are more straightforward ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers. We’ve been able to learn from some of the iterations phone service providers have made to these questions in their phone scripts for call handlers. 

One of the benefits of the phone service is that call handlers can clarify any responses from a participant, to help record accurate information. This is especially useful when a participant might have a complex smoking history of different types of tobacco, and if the amount they smoked changed over time.  

We also know that not all users are comfortable with providing the information we need to ask for. Call handlers can explain why we need certain information to reassure participants and keep them engaged with the service. But a digital service won’t have the same level of reassurance that comes from a personal interaction on a phone call.  

Our focus has been on getting the right balance between capturing enough information for the risk calculation to be accurate, and keeping users engaged so they don't drop out of our service. 

## The information we need for the risk calculation 

For the calculation, we need to know the total number of years someone has smoked tobacco. And the average number of cigarettes they smoke or used to smoke a day. We also know that not everyone smokes cigarettes. We ask participants if they’ve smoked:  

- cigarettes 
- rolling tobacco 
- a pipe
- cigars 
- cigarillos 
- shisha  

For the calculation, we will convert these types of tobacco into an equivalent number of cigarettes. Users can tell us how much they smoked of a type of tobacco in a way that feels familiar to them. And we will do the conversions in the background.  

The service excludes vaping from someone’s smoking history. Currently there isn’t enough evidence about the impact of vaping on someone’s risk of developing lung cancer to include it as part of the risk calculation. 

## Research activities 

To help us design the questions we: 

- recruited users for research who smoke or used to smoke different types of tobacco 
- conducted pop-up research on Edgware road to speak to people who smoke shisha 
- visited a mobile scanning unit to observe face to face appointments and speak to nurses 

Pop-up research involves conducting short informal interviews, observations or usability tests in places where the target audience typically gathers. For example, in libraries, community centres, or in our case, shisha cafes. This approach helped us get access to participants who were otherwise hard to recruit. 

We observed participants smoking shisha as we spoke to them, making it easier for them to recall details or share instances which would not have felt as natural in a planned online setting.  

Our visit to the mobile scanning unit gave us insight into the participant’s experience of their lung health check appointment. We got consent from participants to observe their appointments with the nurse, giving us a full picture of the participant’s experience.  

## Designing for complex scenarios 

We know that some users will have relatively simple smoking histories. For example, if someone smoked roughly the same number of cigarettes a day for most of their life. But we need to design journeys for those users with more complex smoking histories. We heard from users who might have smoked cigarettes daily for 20 years, then moved on to smoking a pipe or cigars more infrequently.  

We also need to design a journey that accommodates users who cannot remember exact dates or details of their smoking history. We created mindset segmentations to help us understand the needs of the users we are designing for. The 3 mindsets we created are:  

- I want to do the right thing, just don’t make me feel judged or confused 
- My smoking life is complicated, and I want that to be reflected 
- I’ll do it if it feels worthwhile, legitimate, and joined-up 

A participant could have one of these mindsets, a combination of all 3, or move between them at different points in their journey. They aren't necessarily relevant to all participants, but they provide a useful reference point when designing our questions. 

Our next design history shares how we thought about the impact of our questions on our users, and on the lung cancer screening programme.
