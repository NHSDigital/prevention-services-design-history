Before we could run a pilot, the team needed to agree on a service name that we could use in the prototype – and for things like printed materials.

Even though the team is called ‘Weight management’, we knew the service couldn’t be called ’Weight management’ because:

- it sets expectations that the service is like the weight management programmes it will be directing people to
- the NHS Digital Weight Management Programme already exists

Naming things can be hard and people often have a lot of opinions about what a good name should be. So we decided to follow a structured process to make sure any name we use:

- communicates what we need it to
- doesn’t conflict with what we want to be communicating

More importantly, the name needs to help users:

- find the service
- understand what the service does
- know the outcome they can achieve by using the service

## Process

Here’s the process we followed:
1. Agree what we want to communicate (messages)
2. Create a list of names that communicate those messages
3. Score the names as a team
4. Use the shortlisted names in context

Next, we’ll test the top‑scoring name with users.

## Messages

We agreed the messages we thought the name could communicate as a team (and ran them past senior leadership people).

These were the messages we thought were most important:
1. Users can use it to find activities to help them make healthy lifestyle changes
2. Users can use it to find activities to help them manage their weight
3. Users can use it to help them make lifestyle changes that last
4. Users will be supported throughout as they try to make healthy lifestyle changes
5. Users can use it to stop themselves from getting ill later on because of unhealthy habits
6. Users can see information that’s personalised for them
7. It is provided by the NHS
8. It’s a service that connects you to activities - it’s not the activity itself
9. It’s a name that still makes sense if the use case for the service goes beyond weight management

## Names

Here are the names we had to choose from.

### Possible names
- NHS help to stay healthy
- NHS personalised prevention platform
- NHS local connect
- NHS healthy habits
- NHS healthier habits
- NHS healthier me
- NHS stay well
- NHS lifestyle choices
- NHS healthier living
- NHS action for health
- NHS change up
- NHS help yourself to healthy
- NHS healthy weight choices
- NHS healthy weight activities
- NHS weight connect

### Discounted names

#### Over‑promising
- Better life

#### Already exist
- NHS LiveWell
- NHS Weight management service
- Better health
- NHS Healthy Choices

#### Too silly
- MatBot
- Help yo’ health
- NHS do a thing to get healthier

## Scoring

When it came to scoring, each team member had their own Excel sheet where they scored the names against the messages.

Each person scored each name:
- 2 if it strongly conveyed the message
- 1 if it partially conveyed the message or did not contradict the message
- 0 if it contradicted the message or did not convey it at all

## Results

Here are the average scores the team gave each name.

| Name                                 | Total |
|--------------------------------------|------:|
| NHS Help to stay healthy             | 14.7  |
| NHS Healthier me                     | 13.1  |
| NHS Healthier living                 | 12.4  |
| NHS Healthy habits                   | 12.3  |
| NHS Healthier habits                 | 12.2  |
| NHS Help yourself to healthy         | 12.1  |
| NHS Stay well                        | 11.0  |
| NHS Lifestyle choices                | 10.6  |
| NHS Healthy weight choices           |  9.3  |
| NHS Healthy weight activities        |  9.2  |
| NHS Action for health                |  8.7  |
| NHS Personalised prevention platform |  8.2  |
| NHS Weight connect                   |  7.7  |
| NHS Local connect                    |  5.2  |
| NHS Change up                        |  4.7  |

The top‑4 scoring names were:
- NHS Help to stay healthy
- NHS Healthier me
- NHS Healthier living
- NHS Healthy habits

## Using the names in context

After the workshop we tried the top‑4 names in contexts we were likely to use them, and discounted the ones that didn’t work so well.

We discounted ‘Healthier me’, for example, because it will be awkward when we’re talking directly to users and saying ‘you’.

When we dropped it in to some existing content, one sentence looked like this:

‘NHS Healthier **me** can match **you** to services **we** think will best work for **you**.’

## The name we’ll test with users

The name we plan to put in front of users in the pilot is the top‑scoring name, which was ’NHS help to stay healthy’.
