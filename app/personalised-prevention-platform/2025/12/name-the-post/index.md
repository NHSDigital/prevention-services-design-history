## Partnering and local

We’ve recently partnered with a local authority as our first testing area. One of the things that we need to do in preparation is to make sure we have a good mix of both national and locally provided activities, facilities, and programmes.


## Manifestations of things that can be presented as options

Talking about preventative activities that can be presented as options. They are kind of all kinds of different things and way back when we started to sort of dig into potentially where these things come from and how they might manifest.

I'm not going to go through all the circles because there's loads like basically the point of this is like the things that our service may potentially recommend are generated all over the place, across our society for want of a better way of putting it, and they manifest in various different ways.

So if you're an interaction designer trying to get from like a load of stuff to choosing a service or option, you get to have lots of fun, yeah?

And so the interaction design for these two is sort of like we have this overall kind of idea of like we need to explain in a certain content design pattern that allows some form of comparison between these things and present certain facts that allow comparison between these things.

But they are fundamentally under the hood sort of fairly different prospects in real life. And so you start to get different chunks of page and different patterns within the page. So people like me start to sort of prick up our ears and go, oh, patterns.


## Example types of these things

### Many places, many timetables, no cost

For example, Park Run is an extremely kind of valuable thing that exists out in society, but it takes place all over the place. It's free.

### Many places and no places, many timetables and no timetables, several costs

And it's sort of like it's out there and going to run out of words at this point, but Weight Watchers, another interesting example, so something that is nationally provided and recommended probably to any given area but many places, but also no places with many timetables, but also no entire tables and several costs.

So if you think about that, it's essentially like it's a weight plan. You can do it on your own using their app, but you pay for the privilege, but you can also pay for the privilege to go to their weekly meetups that also take place on zoom. So the concept of Weight Watchers itself is a fairly kind of like.

I guess well known or understood thing, but the way it embodies itself as a service is actually fantastically complex. So again your kind of page design has to somehow start to take that into account. More fun as we go into Tower Hamlets, we get into the good stuff, which is sort of like.

### One service with several places

OK, one service with several places. So the Tower Hamlets residence hub is, you know, an assistive service to connect people to various things, not just prevention, but all kinds of things. I guess think of it as a like a local citizen's Health Bureau type.

Citizens Advice Bureau type thing, but it's it's fundamentally one service with the same offering, but it has many locations. Well, it has six locations. So how do you make sense of that? But then also we have things like so that's one service several places, no cost.

### One facility type, many places

Then we have one facility type many places, which is another fun one. So something that you know I always think is a really good example of like a facility that you would definitely recommend in a system like this is something like those park gyms. They're freely available, they're out in the world.

All you need to know is how to find one, and if you're interested, you can just go there. It's really simple proposition. Crosstown Hamlets there are sixteen of these dudes, but essentially it's one facility or like one facility type in 16 different places.

### One service containing many services presenting as one service

Should I keep going? What else was I doing? Oh, yeah. So this one's fun. One service containing many services presenting as one service. So this is the NHS digital weight management programme, which presents as a national portal. That's a terrible word, but it presents with a.

A unified service, a surface. But once you're inside it, it fractures into that sort of like localised provision stuff. So while at this point you may not want to understand that from a interaction design or information display point of view, it's an important kind of thing to have in your mind.

Particularly for content design and things like that. Like the way this service enacts itself is is different to other ones. I'll keep going, but I'll stop soon. Don't worry. One service, no place, but about a place containing many routes to many services. So that's a good one. This is one that we probably.

### Er local directories

Probably ideally wouldn't necessarily have as one of our primary things, but it would be remiss to sort of, like, ignore the fact that localised directories of various kinds do already exist so.

It's maybe a potential sort of halfway house between high fidelity service directories and low fidelity service directories, IE existing directories within directories. So I think that's it, yeah.

That kind of leads to sort of this kind of thing where, you know, people like me just start to enjoy ourselves and break things down into little puzzles and make sort of Sudoku looking things. But I think I just thought it was kind of interesting to sort of, I guess, sort of whiz through the the.

The weird complexity of like when.

The idea of prevention is sort of presented as our service recommends things to people. It's like what that actually boils into in terms of interaction design and like the different kind of incarnations of things that could be advised is quite interesting.


## Fidelity
## Scale
## Opportunity


### The perennial issue of fidelity

This is hopefully a smooth segue, but as it's me it probably won't be. But what's interesting about this is a prototype level and a pilot MVP level. I think it's very, very kind of manual. It's very design LED because what we're doing is we're understanding variance.

We're shaping the design of the thing. We're also understanding the right level of fidelity required to meet user needs like so, for example. OK, this takes in a place, takes place in a place, but at what time and what's the timetable for this particular lesson? And how much does it cost and how can I pay for it?

Is it cash? Is it card all like there's so much fidelity that you could go into, but what is the optimum amount of fidelity that starts to let you scale? And so as you scale, as we move out of potentially a pilot MVP, we start to run into these kind of information channel challenges.

And I was kind of sat there this morning going like, oh, man, which is something I do kind of a lot with this stuff. But it's like the challenge of knowing what's available and the challenge of having minimum viable fidelity to meet user needs about the things you're suggesting.

Really clearly kind of illuminated, there is, yeah. This has been a very like it hasn't. It continues to be a very manual process. So I think what I haven't said here is one of the ways that we've been doing this.

Collecting of various activities around the local area is literally like going on to the tower. Hamlet's various directories of services available on their websites and just pulling activities from that and kind of sense checking quality, controlling whether they still exist like.

What are the kind of specifics and details of information we need on them and then putting them into initially into a spreadsheet and that and that kind of helps Matt formulate into these variety of different kind of manual layouts that he's he's created that will go into our design.

So it's been a very, very manual process, very time consuming and also like very content design or like heavy, heavy for a content designer, very time consuming as well in that sense and it's A and so one of the things that we'd have we've had to do because I think when we initially populated that.

That list was there was about like 50 various activities on that list and we started thinking about, OK, that's way too many for us to design quickly. How can we quickly edit those down, cut those down and what kind of considerations what we might we need to take an into?

Yeah, might might we need to make to edit to do those edits and it it became quite quick. Tricky. There were certain things like, OK, there's women only sports pages, but we're not currently asking in our preference in our preferences.

Like what someone's gender is or not. Or there's disability only sports pages. How do we surface those? And I think the tricky thing is we've decided we've made the, like, controversial decision to cut those out of our initial design. But I think what's coming up is like, these are clearly very important things.

So like, how do we as we scale and move forward like how do we begin to think about how we're designing for accessibility and inclusion kind of in the long term, we want to make sure that we're not forgetting those important kind of design considerations going forward or as Matt was talking about as well.

### The perennial issue of scale

And a need for innovative approaches to this space are pretty much the same curve, so you can imagine as you scale up and as multiple discoveries have found in the past, it's not news to be like.

Curating entering the details and maintaining the details of the kind of stuff we're talking about, the kind of eventual scale we're talking about becomes extremely difficult, becomes extremely in the as is, becomes extremely manual and things generally kind of slowly.

They start to degrade, So what kind of you know, it feels like there's a need and it feels like there's an opportunity for kind of innovation exploration in this area that I think we should probably as we sort of start to understand the fidelity and the challenges.

There seem to be opportunities as we're going upwards where you can really start to understand how innovative approaches might do. Some of this heavy lifting and make some of this stuff actually genuinely viable in the real world. Oof. And I will stop sharing and hopefully.

You can get the PowerPoint back and that was an incredible segue into Gillian's last slide. What do you think, Gillian? Was it good?






Well, like how made the scale in the future, right? Like this is a very like time consuming process and manual process for us right now as we start to integrate like different local authorities or local areas into this and also give them the reins.

How do we scale for that and like as arena mentioned, we're working with the DOS team and there's going to be a workshop in the New Year. So like those are those things are kind of in the works, but yeah, hopefully we'll be able to kind of.

Start to do some thoughtful design consideration and design. Thinking around those space. One of the things that we are planning on doing is we're creating a space in confluence to really track these insights and design considerations just so that as we begin to dot design for them in our future iterations, we have those.

Thoughts and insights available somewhere so we know that they're not forgotten about and we're taking them into our future designs? Yep, on the theme confluence. Boring but important. And that is us.
