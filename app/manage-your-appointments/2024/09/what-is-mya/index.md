The service will enable healthcare providers to create and manage availability and appointments

The service is set up to initially support vaccinations, but over a longer term, could be used to support appointments for other services if needed.

## The background

A 3rd party appointments management solution was procured by the NHS in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Manage your appointments service was designed to replace the existing 3rd party software, and provide more flexibility for expansion of appointment management services.

## Where we are

We’ve built an minimum viable product (MVP), and are testing our service with users delivering the RSV vaccination service in the east of England.

The service will expand in line with the community pharmacy expansion initiative, and we plan to continue testing and improving the service, to support further expansion, including COVID-19 and flu vaccines.
