### Research aims

1. To better understand which pieces of content users, find useful and not so useful when accessing an HPV self-testing service.

2. To identify which pieces of content work best for invitations, start page, support pages and information to accompany the kit.

### Hypothesis

As this is a new service, participants will want a lot of information up front and in information will need to be repeated in multiple locations.

### Methodology

Using card sorting method, participants were first asked without prompts what information they would find useful if they were to take part in an HPV self-testing service.

Once they had told us this, participants were then asked to sort through the given prompts and place them in one or more of the provided locations:

1. Invitation message
2. Service start page (landing page)
3. Health support page on NHS.UK website
4. Self-testing kit
5. "I do not need this information"

The prompts the participants were given can be split as:

- Clinical information about HPV
- How HPV testing and its relation to cervical screening
- Self-testing accuracy
- Eligibility for the service
- HPV vaccine
- How to use the kit
- How to order a kit
- How to take and return the sample
- Receiving the results and what do they mean

> [!NOTE]
> For this round, we recruited participants that were identifying as neurodiverse or having dyslexia, as well as from the trans and non-binary communities. The participants’ ages ranged between 25-54.

### Design findings

#### 1. Invitations

- 5 of 6 Participants would like to know about HPV – information about how it is spread and treated.
- 5 of 6 participants find it useful to know about the eligibility criteria - who should and shouldn’t be taking the test.
- All participants wanted an invite to include information on how to order the kit, what will be in the kit, how to return a sample and information on which address the kit can be sent out to.

#### 2. Start page

- 4 of 6 participants would like to know information about what HPV is, what self-testing is, what support is available and how to cease communication with the service.
- 5 of 6 participants would like information about who shouldn’t take a self-testing test, with 3/5 mentioning they would specifically like to know if pregnant people are eligible.
- All participants wanted to know about the ordering sample taking process. In particular, the full journey from invite to results, how long it will take to receive a kit once an order is made, what comes inside the kit, how to return a sample and information about which address a kit can be sent to.

#### 3. NHS Support page – this is where participants wanted the most information

- All participants want to know information that we classified as "About HPV" – symptoms, how common it is, how it is spread, a full definition and how it can be treated and any support that patients might need.
- 5 of 6 participants found it helpful to have information about what cervical screening is and how it links to HPV self-testing links to cervical screening.
- 4 of 6 participants found it useful to know about the accuracy of self-testing and if there is the possibility of a false negative.
- 5 of 6 participants found it useful to have information on who shouldn’t self-sample and if it is safe for pregnant people.
- 5 of 6 participants were interested in how the HPV vaccination affects self-testing.
- 4 of 6 participants found the support page to be somewhere they would want to know how to use the kit, with the alternative being within the kit itself.
- All participants mentioned they would find information on results useful here. This includes information on when results will be received and what to do in the event of a HPV positive or HPV negative result.
- For participants who identified as non-binary, they would like to know more on when a full cervical screen would be needed as this causes dysphoria so its particularly important to know that ahead of taking part.

#### 4. In the kit

- Most participants did not put many cards/ prompts in this area as they felt only essential information regarding the sample taking process should be placed within the kit. Anything else they should be able to find on a support page.
- 4 of 6 participants would find it useful to have information on accuracy of self-testing and the possibility of a false negative.
- All participants would find an infographic useful as well as a numbered list on how to use the kit. This provides visual but also written understanding of the process.

#### 5. Information participants didn’t think they’d need

- Information about whether HPV self-testing is accurate: "if it is not, then this method should not be approved by the NHS"

- Information about whether the kit is painful or difficult to use: "this is something that is relative and different for each person"

#### Important things to note

1. Most participants asked to have a variation of information across each content piece rather than just one.

This does not mean we will have the exact same content in each place but does highlight that users do want reminding of specific aspects of the service throughout the user journey.

2. Certain medications may make it difficult to collect a sample:

- Testosterone can affect vaginal tissues contributing to atrophy, meaning tissues can become thin and less elastic.
- Menopause medications can also lead to reduction in oestrogen and can result in atrophy.
- Content that makes clear what to do if you have vaginal dryness or atrophy which could make taking samples more uncomfortable.

3. For participants with dyslexia, there were specific needs for content:

- Understanding the risks of not testing
- Making sure to use human papillomavirus rather than HPV
- Clearly outlining any risk categories (circumstances that make it more important to test)
- Understanding the wider impact - the success of HPV self-testing, why this method has been chosen and how its helping people long term

### What's next

We will be testing our digital invitations, the ordering joureny and follow-up communications with more of our target cohort as we aim to speak to users who are neurodiverse, and people who use screen readers.
