        Research findings: Generally this email tested well.

        - A couple of participants felt that it would be better to explain what the vaccine protected against before asking for consent.

        - When asked, participants said they would expect an email like this to come from the school rather than from the NHS.

        Research findings:

        None of the parents we spoke to were aware that children could give/refuse consent themselves, and their reactions to this information varied hugely.

        Those who had given consent were generally happy with the idea of their child receiving this email, but expressed mild concern about their child being able to refuse the vaccine after the parent had consented.

        One parent said they could imagine that if pupils realised they could say no to the vaccine then it would spread across the year with many trying to get out of having it.

        The 2 participants who had refused consent for the HPV vaccine felt very angry at the idea of their child being able to ‘overrule’ that decision and choose to have the vaccine.

        Several participants, regardless of whether they had said yes or no to the vaccine, also felt that sending this email to their child undermined the purpose of asking the parent for consent at all and felt it made the process of giving parental consent pointless.

    - Your email address
    - Confirm your email address
    - text: What is your child’s name?
      caption: "Research findings: Some participants struggled with understanding the purpose of the ‘known as’ field - one retyped her child’s full name as she thought she needed to confirm that this was the name he was known by."
    - What is your child’s date of birth?
    - Confirm your child’s school
    - About you
    - Do you agree to them getting vaccine?
    - "If they do not agree: Reason they do not agree"
    - "If they do agree: Is your child registered with a GP?"
    - Home address
    - text: Do you know their NHS number?
      caption: "Research findings: Nobody knew their child’s NHS number, or felt they would be able to find it easily."
    - We need to ask some health questions
    - Any severe allergies?
    - Any existing medical conditions?
    - text: Any regular medication?
      caption: "Research findings: A couple of participants felt taken aback by the mention of contraception as they felt their child was too young for this to be relevant.
    - Anything else?"
    - Checking MMR status
    - text: Has child had their MMR doses?
      caption: "Research findings: Most participants were not able to accurately say for sure whether their child had both doses, but said they would put yes as they believed the child was up to date with all vaccines offered."

An overview of the journey for parents who are giving consent for their child to receive the HPV vaccine. These are the designs as we built them before our first round of research with parents.

During the research this journey generally tested well, and parents were able to fill the form out easily with only a few issues, which are detailed below against the relevant screenshots.
