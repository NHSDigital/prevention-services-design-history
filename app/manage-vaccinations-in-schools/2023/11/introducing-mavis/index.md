We recently did a round of research with SAIS nurses to test some significant changes to the [handling of consent responses](/manage-vaccinations-in-schools/2023/11/multiple-consent-responses) and [triage notes](/manage-vaccinations-in-schools/2023/11/multiple-triage-notes). During testing, every nurse we spoke to commented that the name of our service – Manage vaccinations for school-aged children – wasn’t particularly snappy. Their existing systems (Cinnamon and Riviam, for example) have much shorter names, which makes it easy for teams to refer to the systems internally.

## We needed a new name

While we recognised the need for a snappier name, we also wanted the name of our service to be clear, logical and descriptive, in line with [NHS naming guidance](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/naming-principles/).

After some reflection, we decided to keep a verb-based, descriptive name – Manage vaccinations in schools – but we’ve now added an abbreviation, which SAIS teams can use easily among themselves.

Reader, we’d like to introduce you to Mavis.

We’ll report back on how the new name tests in future research sessions.
