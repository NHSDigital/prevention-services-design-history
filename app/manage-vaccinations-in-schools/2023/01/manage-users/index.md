There is a need to manage who can and cannot access the service.

Typically, users need to:

- add users
- remove users
- edit users (names, email addresses)
- change user permissions
- temporarily suspend a user (for example, maternity)

We don’t know if there are established patterns for doing this in NHS services. If the service uses some sort of integrated sign-in, then these pages will probably change.

These designs are a first-pass to indicate what features might be available, and to gauge users’s response to them.

We have purposefully avoided the concept of bank staff for now.

## Permissions

We need more research to understand what permissions different users will need. Bank users will probably need different roles and access.

For the pilot, we anticipate that all users will have the same permissions. This is also based on the hypothesis that bank staff are predominantly needed during flu season in autumn, and the pilot will run through the summer.
