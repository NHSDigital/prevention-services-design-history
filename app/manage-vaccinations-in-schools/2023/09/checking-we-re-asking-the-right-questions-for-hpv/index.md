To make sure we’re asking the right questions when requesting consent for vaccinations, and not burdening users unnecessarily, we’ve created something called a [question protocol](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/06/the-question-protocol-how-to-make-sure-every-form-field-is-necessary.php).

This shows:

- what we ask
- why we ask it
- what we do with the answers we get
