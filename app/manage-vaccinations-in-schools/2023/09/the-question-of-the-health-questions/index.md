title: The question of the health questions

All our consent journeys include health questions. If a parent agrees for their child to have a vaccination in school, they answer a series of questions about the child’s health. Nurses triage the answers to these questions to make sure the child stays safe.

We know from our research that different SAIS teams use different health questions for different vaccines. While the sorts of questions asked are generally similar, the number of questions asked varies, as does the wording used.

## To standardise or not to standardise

An important decision for our team is whether to have standardised sets of questions within our service (such as those suggested by the UK Health Security Agency), or whether to allow SAIS teams to tailor health questions according to their preferences.

While there are obvious advantages to standardising questions, we think that getting all SAIS teams to agree to this approach and adopt the agreed questions could take some time.

For the pilot we plan to run in Cumbria this autumn, we’ve agreed to go with the questions currently used by Cumbria’s SAIS team for flu vaccinations. These are subtly different from UKHSA’s questions and the questions we originally had in our service.

We’re testing these questions in the research we’re currently doing with parents, and we’ll keep a close eye on how parents respond to them during the pilot.

We’ll report back on what we learn, and whether we decide to standardise the health questions.
