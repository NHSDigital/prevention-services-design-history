Current requests for consent from schools can be really bad. They can be waffly with no call to action, meaning they are not effective in gathering consent from parents.

Details are often in a PDF attached to an email.

Quality is really variable.

Our hypothesis is that if we can manage consent requests centrally, we can make them consistent and effective.

We also need to consider [how to ask for consent in ways other than email](/manage-vaccinations-in-schools/2022/11/alternative-consent-requests/).

## An alternative consent request

We drafted a consent request email and a consent reminder for a flu vaccination.

We aimed to keep this email as simple as possible.

We give details about when and where vaccinations are taking place, and there is a clear call to action to give or refuse consent.

This is followed by extra information about the flu vaccine and contact details for the SAIS team.

## An email from the NHS

Our hypothesis is also that this email will carry more weight if it comes from the NHS, rather than a school, amidst all the other usual school communications.
