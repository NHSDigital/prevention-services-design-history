Consent needs to be inclusive, and must avoid digital exclusion.

It doesn’t have to be done only by email.

## Paper consent

Some SAIS teams have not started using digital yet, presumably this means their consent is all done by paper.

Many teams also use digital consent alongside paper consent – whether by choice, or because digital uptake is too low. This is creating an extra burden for teams when triaging consent. This doesn’t mean paper is a bad option – it means we might need to somehow do the hard work to make paper efficient.

We haven’t seen any examples of paper consent forms. We assume that these are forms sent home with children.

We should explore, ‘What would a good paper consent process look like?’

## Telephone consent

[A study by Bristol University](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/implementing-new-consent-procedures-for-the-schools-based-hpv-vac) has shown that telephone requests for consent for HPV vaccines were successful. In the study they had school children call their parents, from school, just before their vaccination, to get consent.

> Expanding the consent procedures for the schools-based HPV vaccination programme to include parental telephone consent was broadly welcomed by the immunisation nurses, parents, and young women in our study.

We should consider how we could incorporate something like this.

- Could a school share phone numbers with us?
- Could a phone number be given to parents for them to call and give consent?

Ideas include:

- Direct calls from SAIS team to parents
- An automated phone call service, using numeric options
- Sending requests by text message

## Self consent (Gillick competence)

- People aged 16 or over are entitled to consent to their own treatment
- Children under the age of 16 can consent to their own treatment if they have enough intelligence, competence and understanding to know what’s involved in their treatment. This is known as being Gillick competent.

[More about children and consent on NHS.UK](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/children/)

We need to establish if there is a user need to empower young people to give consent themselves. What happens when a parent does not give consent, but a child under 16 wants to?

### Self consent and HPV

The [Bristol University study](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/implementing-new-consent-procedures-for-the-schools-based-hpv-vac) found that self-consent was rare for young women aged 12-13 years:

> The requirement for young women to confirm that they had discussed vaccination with their parents, and that vaccination would not cause difficulties at home, meant adolescent self-consent was rare in this age-group.
