There are three separate consent journeys for school-aged immunisations.

1. [Flu vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/child-flu-vaccine/)
2. [HPV vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/hpv-human-papillomavirus-vaccine/)
3. Combined [3 in 1 teenage booster or Td/IPV](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/3-in-1-teenage-booster/) with [MenACWY](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/meningitis/vaccination/)

The HPV and Td/IPV with MenACWY journeys both also prompt for MMRs if they’ve been missed.

The first pages of the Cinnamon HPV consent journey are the same for flu, HPV and 3 in 1 with MenACWY. See the [flu journey for screenshots](/manage-vaccinations-in-schools/2022/10/cinnamon-consent-flu/#start-page).

The journey for ‘HPV’ and ‘3-in-1 with MenACWY’ are identical, except for different vaccines being asked for on the consent page.

## Student details

Parents are asked for their child’s ‘Sex’, but in the flu journey it was ‘Gender’.

Year groups and date of birth years are limited to those eligible for the vaccines.

There is no validation on the address, NHS number or parent telephone number. You can enter anything.

## Medical history

The questions being asked are more generic than with flu. Where flu asked for egg allergies, aspirin medication and asthma, here parents are asked for existing conditions and regular medication, and ‘anything else you should know’, which might cover pregnancy.

## Consent model

Parents give consent for the full vaccination course (initial dose and booster dose) for HPV. Presumably this means no consent is requested 6 months later, when boosters are due.

On the consent page, the options for relationship to child include ‘Self-consent’:

- Mother
- Father
- Legal Guardian
- Self-consent
- Other (a text field asks for details)

Self-consent is kind of hidden here. It’s not clear from this journey that a student could be completing this themselves.

## MMR catch-up

In the medical history, parents are asked:

> Has the child named on this form received two doses of the MMR vaccine since the age of one?

If the answer is No, then the parent is asked to give consent for an MMR vaccination.

MMR vaccines are not given in school, instead parents will be invited to catch-up clinics.
