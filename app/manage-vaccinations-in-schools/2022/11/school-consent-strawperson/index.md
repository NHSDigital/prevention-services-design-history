Following the [parental consent journey](/manage-vaccinations-in-schools/2022/11/give-or-refuse-flu-vaccination-strawperson/), we:

- explored what features a school might see
- drafted consent request email
- drafted consent reminder

The largest questions we had when designing these pages related to the upload of contacts and the sending of requests.

Questions include:

- How do we refer to a vaccination ‘campaign’? We think campaign is right, but we need to check.
- Who should be responsible for sending the consent request? The school or SAIS?
- How far in advance should the consent requests be sent? Cinnamon consent was requested 1 month in advance.
- How long should we wait until sending a reminder?
- Who decides which children are eligible for the vaccine? – Sometimes a CHIS will send a list of children who are eligible to the SAIS provider
- What information would the school upload to the NHS service?
- What information can they share under GDPR?
- Would reminder requests be sent automatically?
- How do we accommodate [alternatives to requesting consent by email](/manage-vaccinations-in-schools/2022/11/alternative-consent-requests/)?
