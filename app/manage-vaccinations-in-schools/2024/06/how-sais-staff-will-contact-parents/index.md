title: How SAIS staff will contact parents

SAIS teams need to contact the parents/carers of children within their cohort, to offer them vaccinations for their children. Currently, different teams do this in a variety of ways, like:

- maintaining their own contact lists across multiple years
- using contact details from their Child Health Information Service (CHIS)
- obtaining parents’ contact details from their children’s school
- asking the children’s schools to send messages through the school distribution lists and comms platforms
- using contact details from the Personal Demographics Service (PDS),

and combinations of the above.

## Pilot

During the Mavis pilot, the participating SAIS teams collected email addresses and phone numbers from participating families. Consent requests were then sent directly to the email addresses of the pilot parents using [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/). One of the pilot learnings was that some parents would have preferred to receive SAIS comms by text. Comms over text was originally planned to be included in the pilot, but was eventually dropped when the Mavis team ran out of time.

## Private beta

We evaluated using [NHS Notify](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-notify) for parent comms. At the time of writing, if provided with an NHS number, NHS Notify fetches the contact details against that NHS number in Personal Demographics Service (PDS), and uses those contact details to send out NHS app notifications, text messages, emails or letters.

For private beta, we have decided to continue to deliver messages using GOV.UK Notify. Choosing NHS Notify over GOV.UK Notify would result in an operational change for SAIS teams, as NHS Notify contact details (i.e. the ones from PDS) are less likely to be up-to-date than those gathered during the SAIS process. Such an operational change should only be done with the involvement of the SAIS team, after building up a quantitative evidence base that PDS contact details get a better response than what SAIS currently does.

## Restricted patient records

Some patient records in PDS are [restricted or “S-flagged”](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service/national-back-office-for-the-personal-demographics-service/management-of-nhs-numbers-and-pds-records#restricting-access-to-a-patient-s-record). This is to ensure that patient location information such as the patient’s address or landline phone number is protected from viewing by healthcare professionals.

This is to protect vulnerable patients, for example:

- victims of domestic violence
- victims of forced marriages
- family break-ups
- vulnerable children awaiting adoption (the flag is not set for adoption cases, but it may be requested for children who are on the pathway to adoption or post adoption on specific request – this is likely due to specific vulnerabilities rather than the adoption)
- law court witnesses
- patients who are keen to restrict as much data that is held about them as possible, for their own personal reasons/their feeling this is their human right
- short-term protection pending identity change

Having a sensitive flag applied to your record is ultimately a patient’s individual choice (or their parent’s) rather than being rule-based.

SAIS teams currently source their contact details from two main places: schools and CHIS teams. Schools and CHIS teams both have their own independent processes in place to ensure that they have appropriate contact information for vulnerable children, and therefore SAIS do not apply any further checks.

When using NHS Notify, it is not possible to contact people with an S flag at all. This would reduce the ability of the SAIS team to offer vaccinations to every child within their cohort, as per their responsibility, and risks widening health inequalities.

## Future considerations

In future, the Mavis team could explore:

- how sending comms and updates through the NHS app compares to text messages and emails
- what might happen if Mavis pushed the contact details collected through SAIS back into PDS. This brings opportunities e.g. potential for increasing the deliverability of messaging in other clinical settings due to up-to-date contact details, risks e.g. of unexpectedly replacing the contact details for one parent in PDS with another parent’s details, and challenges e.g. clearly explaining to the end user what the implications of updating their PDS details would be, while not distracting them from giving consent.
