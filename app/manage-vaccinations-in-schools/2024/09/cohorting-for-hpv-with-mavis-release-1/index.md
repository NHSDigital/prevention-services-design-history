title: Cohorting for the HPV programme with Mavis in 2024/25
date: 2024-09-19

Mavis will be available for Coventry and Warwickshire SAIS team to use to run their HPV programme in 2024/25 from Monday 2nd December 2024.

All young people in school year 8 who attend school in the C&W area, or who do not attend school but who live or have a GP in the area, are eligible for the HPV vaccination for the first time in 2024/25. Additionally, all young people in school year 9, 10 and 11 who were not vaccinated in previous academic years are eligible for a catch up vaccination. SAIS teams need to invite all of these children to get a HPV vaccination this year.

Even though they are vaccinated at the same time, officially, children in different academic years and with different biological sexes form different cohorts:

- Catch ups for year 9, 10 and 11 are treated as an extension of the previous years’ programmes (in this case the 2023/24, 2022/23 and 2021/22 programmes respectively)
- Each sex is treated as a separate cohort.

These distinctions are important for measuring uptake and other reporting needs.

There are currently 101 secondary schools in the C&W area. In recent years the eligible year 8 cohort has comprised around 12,000 people. Including all those eligible for catch ups, the total cohort may be around 20,000.

Coventry and Warwickshire are unusual amongst SAIS teams in that their CHIS does not provide a list of the children in the eligible cohorts at the start of their programmes. Instead, they base their cohorts only on information from the education system. C&W request a copy of the Local Authority’s nominal roll twice a year, following on from the May and October school censuses.

SAIS teams need lists of children in all academic year groups from the start of the year to run the Flu program, which runs each autumn term for all children from reception through to year 11. They are then able to use the information gathered in the flu programme as the basis for their cohorts for the next two programmes, including HPV.

The flu programme cohort is initially based on the May census, as the October census arrives too late. SAIS teams report that information they receive before the summer holidays about school intentions for next year tends to change quite a bit by the time September comes around.

C&W use the information from the May census to create their schedule for visiting schools, as the information is accurate enough to get a rough cohort size, so they can predict time and staff required to vaccinate.

However, to maintain an accurate nominal roll, C&W then request class lists directly from schools (like most other SAIS teams). C&W have a lead nurse for each of their schools, and their current process is for the nurse to request the class lists at the same time as sending the school the consent request template, 3 weeks in advance of the scheduled session.

Nurses ask schools for a parent phone number for each child at this point, in order to send texts to non-responders, but in the current process, schools have primary responsibility for communicating with parents, so parent contact information is not mandatory. The class lists are not currently integral to the process of contacting parents.

One of the major goals of the Mavis beta is to validate that communicating with parents directly through NHS branded channels with consistently designed messaging will make it easier for parents to respond to consent requests and SAIS teams to chase non responders, with the aim of improving uptake.

In order to do this, C&W have agreed to make some changes to their operational process. We have provided C&W with a message for their lead nurses to share with secondary schools, explaining that they are trialling a new method for requesting consent from parents and that as part of this, they will need all schools to provide email and mobile contact details for parents in their school lists. This will also need to happen earlier than the 3 weeks before a session used in previous programs, to give SAIS nurses time to input the information back into Mavis and issue consent requests themselves.

We will have a backup option available if any schools completely refuse, in which nurses are able to share an email template for the school to send out as they currently do, but we hope that this will not be necessary.

## Beta cohorting process

### Before Mavis is live

1. C&W’s nominal rolls will have already been updated throughout flu season with information from both school lists and parent consent responses to have up to date information about which child goes to which school and their parent’s contact info. However, response rates for the flu campaign in secondary schools are low, so contact information will still be missing for many.
2. In November, according to the newly agreed process, each lead nurse will request new school lists for all year 8, 9, 10s and 11s from their secondary schools in the new template, with email and mobile contact information for up to 2 parents for each child.
3. Mavis release one will go live already set up with a HPV programme for 2024/25. There will be four cohorts linked to the programme:
   - 2021/22 year 8s (current year 11s)
   - 2022/23 year 8s (current year 10s)
   - 2023/24 year 8s (current year 9s)
   - 2024/25 year 8s (current year 8s)

### When Mavis is live (Mon 2nd December)

1. C&W’s admin team will upload their entire year 8, 9, 10 and 11 nominal rolls into Mavis as one or more cohort uploads. Based on the date of birth of the child, Mavis will automatically sort the children into the correct HPV cohort. If they don’t fit into any of the cohorts, then Mavis will raise an error and won’t import them.
2. The admin team will bulk-upload vaccination records of those children in year 9, 10 and 11 who have already been vaccinated in the previous years’ programmes.
3. Using Mavis’ one record per child model, Mavis will therefore know which children from each cohort are already vaccinated, and which are eligible for vaccination in this programme
4. When lead nurses receive the class lists for year 8, 9, 10 and 11 back from schools, they will upload these directly into Mavis as cohort records (separate uploads by school).
5. Mavis automatically matches the new records to those already in the system, and adds the new parent contact information to existing child records where it does not already exist. Where Mavis cannot reliably find an exact match to a child, the nurse will be prompted to find the correct match manually, or create a new record if the child is new to the area.
6. Records for any children who were previously thought to be in that school but weren’t on the class list will be flagged to the nurse to be moved to the “unknown school” list.
7. Once the class lists are uploaded for a given school, the lead nurse can add a new school session, select the school and select that HPV will be the only vaccination type available. The nurse will then see a list of all eligible children from all active programs who have not yet had the HPV vaccination, to add them to the school session.
