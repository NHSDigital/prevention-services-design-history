title: How health questions varied in the Mavis pilot

UKHSA has a template consent form which they recommend for use by SAIS teams to get parental consent for the HPV vaccination.

This consent form has only one screening question. The question is:

> Does your child have a disease or treatment that severely affects their immune system?

It also provides helper text underneath the question:

> It is recommended that children with severe immunosuppression receive 3 doses of HPV vaccine.

None of the SAIS teams who participated in the Mavis pilot use this exact question. Instead, teams typically ask about health conditions in general, and have specific questions on other topics:

- **additional needs**: 1 of 3 pilot teams asked parents if their child had additional needs relating to communicating or vaccinations. This covers needle-phobic children, deaf children, children with learning difficulties and other needs. To our team, this seems to be really important for making reasonable adjustments for these children.
- **allergy / severe reaction to vaccines**: 3 of 3 pilot teams asked parents if their child has had a severe reaction to a vaccine before.
- **allergies in general**: 2 of 3 pilot teams asked parents if their child has any other serious allergies (latex has been cited as a relevant example). The third asked parents if their child has had any unexplained anaphylactic reactions in the past.
- **already vaccinated**: 2 of 3 pilot teams asked parents if their child has already had the HPV vaccination. This is relevant for children who were vaccinated in another country or have moved schools within the last year (SAIS won’t have access to this information any other way). Parents can refuse because their child is already vaccinated, but some may not be aware their child only needs HPV once, so give consent again
- **bleeding disorders**: 1 of 3 pilot teams asks if the child takes anti-coagulant medication. This may change when, how and even where a child is vaccinated. This team also asks generally if the child has any medical problems though so it could come up at that point.
- **fainting**: 1 of 3 pilot teams asks if the child is prone to fainting. children prone to fainting are brought for vaccination where they aren’t visible to their peers, to avoid setting off a chain reaction
- **any medical conditions**: 2 of 3 pilot teams ask if the child has any medical conditions. This doesn’t require parents to know whether their child’s particular condition causes immunosuppression or not.

To standardise the questions we ask across all teams using Mavis, we would need to do two things:

- identify, for each topic, whether to ask parents about this or not
- for the topics we will ask about, come up with a question wording that works for everyone
