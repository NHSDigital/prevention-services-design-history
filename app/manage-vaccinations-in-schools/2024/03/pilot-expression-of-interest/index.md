        The expression of interest form used a plain, unbranded design, with all questions appearing on one page.

        This was to prevent causing confusion with the NHS-branded consent journey which asks many of the same questions.

The following images are a snapshot of the expression of interest journey used for the pilot that ran in March 2024.

Children were eligible for the pilot if:

- they were part of the existing cohort that the SAIS team had already planned to vaccinate at participating schools (children at other schools or in other year groups were not eligible)

- they had not already had the HPV vaccine

- their parent/guardian had completed a consent form according to the current process (it did not matter whether the response was to give or refuse consent)

Each SAIS team was also limited to including 100 children in their pilot cohort, typically 50 per school.

A link to this form was sent by schools to parents whose children would be vaccinated in an upcoming HPV campaign. Responses to this form would then be used to select the cohort for the pilot against the above criteria.
