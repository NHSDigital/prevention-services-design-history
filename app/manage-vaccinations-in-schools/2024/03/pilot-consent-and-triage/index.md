        If there are unmatched responses (that is, responses the system could not [automatically match](/manage-vaccinations-in-schools/2023/12/matching-consent-responses-to-childrens-records/) to existing patient records), a link is shown to a section where these responses can be reconciled.
    - Unmatched consent responses
    - Search for a child record
    - text: Link consent response with child record?
      caption: Any values that don’t match are highlighted in yellow.
    - Unmatched consent responses – Confirmation of matched record
    - text: Patient record with no consent response

        While the journey to assess Gillick competence was available, the pilot was structured in such a way that SAIS teams didn’t need to use it.

        A member of the SAIS team could use the ‘Get consent’ journey when chasing consent and contacting a parent by phone.
    - text: Get consent – Who are you trying to get consent from?
      caption: Details for ‘Full name’ and ‘Phone number’ were pre-filled using information from the expression of interest forms. In the future, users would be able to choose from information found in a team’s CHIS records.
    - Get consent – Do they agree to them having the HPV vaccination?
    - text: Get consent – Consent given – Health questions
      caption: |
        The same questions used in the [parental consent journey](/manage-vaccinations-in-schools/2024/03/pilot-parental-consent/) are shown here, but on one page.
    - Get consent – Consent given – Check and confirm answers
    - text: Get consent – Consent refused – Why are they refusing to give consent?
      caption: Like the parent consent journey, choosing ‘Vaccine already received’, ‘Vaccine will be given elsewhere’, ‘Medical reasons’ or ‘Other’ takes the user to a second page asking for more details.
    - Get consent – Consent refused – Check and confirm answers
    - text: Patient record with consent given response
      caption: The final card on a child’s record (‘Did they get the HPV vaccine’) was only shown when a session was in progress.
    - Patient record with consent refused response
    - Patient record with conflicting consent responses
    - Triage health questions
    - Patient record which needs triage
    - Patient record with triage completed
