## Planning school visits

At the beginning of the academic year, SAIS teams need to know how many children are in each school in their area so they can make a schedule for when they will visit each school and how they will staff the visits. At this point, complete accuracy is not so important as the records are mainly being used at the aggregate level.

They also need to know about all the children who live in the area and don’t attend a school in a different SAIS region (homeschooled and not in education children).

Regional SAIS areas sometimes map to either an ICS area or a Local Authority area and sometimes do not align with either.

Contractually, SAIS cohort lists are produced by and sourced from CHIS and local authorities via the school census. The SAIS spec says that SAIS must source this information from CHIS, local authorities and schools.

## Preparing for school visits

Then, around a month before each planned visit to a school for a given programme (so on a daily basis every school day throughout the year) SAIS teams need lists of all of the children who are currently attending the school in the eligible year groups, so that they can send their parents a consent request for a school session in a month’s time.

This needs to be the exact list of children attending the school as of that date, which can be different from the local authority / census list by several percent due to school moves throughout the year. It needs to include all children with or without a GP / NHS number.

The SAIS spec requires that SAIS send the offer to 100% of eligible children so they can’t accept this list being out of date.

SAIS teams have found that only the school itself has a timely enough view of this information.

## Determining eligibility

SAIS teams need their cohort records to include all the children in the year group at a given school, regardless of whether they are already vaccinated. They then need to know about each child’s vaccination history for the following vaccines:

- HPV
- MenACWY
- Td/IPV
- MMR
- Flu

including any doses they have already had, the dates of these doses and the dose sequence.

SAIS teams need access to the details of all children in the age group and their vaccination history rather than just knowing about the unvaccinated cohort so that, for example, when a child presents in a school session, they can tell the difference between someone who is not eligible because they have already had the vaccine, and someone who is simply not on the list because they have recently moved, but whose parents should be contacted to get consent.

## Contacting parents

Finally, SAIS teams need to contact the parents of the eligible children in a school to send out the consent request to vaccinate at school. This is currently done based on contact information held by schools, who keep up to date contact information for every child, and not based on PDS, which has stale contacts for a proportion of children.

## Existing ways of working

Many SAIS teams already have direct access to CHIS systems in their area, from which they source the cohort information they need. Others have data sharing processes in place with CHIS and Local Authorities to receive this data at regular intervals.

All SAIS teams rely on individual school level data to ensure a 100% offer, whether through the school sharing the records or the school sending out the offer on the SAIS team’s behalf.
