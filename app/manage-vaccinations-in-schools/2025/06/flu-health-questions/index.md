title: Asking parents the right health questions for flu
date: 2025-06-17
---

For the 2025 flu programme, we reviewed the health questions currently asked by SAIS teams, as well as those recommended by the UKHSA.

Given the high volume of children vaccinated against flu each year, it’s important for this programme to make sure parents only give details for health conditions that are contraindications for either the nasal spray, injected vaccine, or both.

After researching with parents, including those from different faith communities, we refined these to make sure that we gave enough guidance to help parents answer correctly and with the right amount of detail.

We also provided space for parents to give teams extra information about their child, such as any other medical conditions or whether they need extra support. While vaccinators can see this information on the patient’s page before and during the session, these answers will not require triage ahead of a session.

## Health questions asked for the nasal flu spray

> ### Has your child been diagnosed with asthma?

This question is used to check for any contraindications for the nasal spray.

Answering ‘Yes’ to this question will show the parent 2 follow up questions. Only questions answered ‘Yes’ will require triage:

1. Does your child take oral steroids for their asthma?

   Hint text: ‘This does not include medicine taken through an inhaler’.

   Give details hint text: ‘Include the steroid name, dose and end date of the course’.

2. Has your child ever been admitted to intensive care because of their asthma?

   Hint text: ‘This does not include visits to A&E or stays in hospital wards outside the intensive care unit’.

> ### Does your child have a disease or treatment that severely affects their immune system?

This question is used to check for any contraindications for the nasal spray.

> ### Is your child in regular close contact with anyone currently having treatment that severely affects their immune system?

Give details hint text: ‘Let us know if they are able to avoid contact with the immunocompromised person for 2 weeks’.

This question is used to check for any contraindications for the nasal spray.

> ### Does your child have a bleeding disorder or are they taking anticoagulant therapy?

Later in the consent journey a parent can choose to give consent for the injected vaccine if a nurse decides it should be given as an alternative.

This question is used to ensure that if the injected vaccine is given, it is administered safely.

> ### Has your child ever been admitted to intensive care due to a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to egg?

This question is used to check for any contraindications for the nasal spray.

> ### Has your child had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the nasal flu vaccine, or any ingredient of the vaccine?

Hint text: ‘This includes gelatine, neomycin or gentamicin’.

This question is used to check for any contraindications for the nasal spray.

> ### Does your child have any other medical conditions the immunisation team should be aware of?

This question **does not require triage**. It is used to give parents the opportunity to give any further information about the health of their child. While used for context, answers are not contraindicating.

> ### Does your child take regular aspirin?

Hint text: ‘Also known as Salicylate therapy’

This question is used to check for any contraindications for the nasal spray.

> ### Has your child had a flu vaccination in the last 3 months?

This question is used to check or confirm whether the child needs a flu vaccination this year.

> ### Does your child need extra support during vaccination sessions?

The hint text is ‘For example, they’re autistic, or extremely anxious’.

This question **does not require triage**. It is used to help teams manage sessions and give support to any children who may need it.
