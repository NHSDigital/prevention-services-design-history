Our collaborative sessions with the program enabled us to generate fresh ideas, refine existing ones, and validate them through stress-testing with subject matter experts. This co-creation process laid the foundation for shaping a future cohorting journey that is both user-centred and technically sound.

## What we did

We began by translating the strongest ideas into a first draft of the future cohorting journey. Using Mural, our team developed several rough iterations, focusing on high-level concepts while deliberately avoiding premature solutionising.

Through this iterative process, we merged two of the three key ideas, discarding the third after assessing its feasibility and alignment. The outcome was a first-pass journey map that captured the experience of key users (participants, clinicians, diabetic eye screening providers, and QA teams).

To ensure the journey was viable, we engaged technical teams, product leads, and business analysts to gather feedback and validate both the user-centred design and technical feasibility.

In parallel, we created a system-agnostic flow, ensuring the design could stand independently of existing systems and wasn’t simply retrofitted to current products.

## Workshop: playback and feedback

We shared our progress in a workshop focused on the potential future journey for DES, highlighting three core areas for transformative change:

- Improving the quality and completeness of cohort data
- Enhancing the accuracy of cohort selection
- Increasing confidence that individuals within the cohort are genuinely DES-eligible

These concepts were presented through a system-agnostic flow and initial user journey, keeping the focus on solving the right problems rather than anchoring to specific technologies.

The session provided invaluable feedback from Product and Program Leads, which was critical for refining and strengthening the proposed journey.
