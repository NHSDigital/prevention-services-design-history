To ensure our proposed ideas were clinically sound and grounded in real-world practice, we engaged clinicians across several feedback sessions. These conversations helped validate our thinking, challenge assumptions, and surface new considerations for future scope discussions. 

We focused on three key areas: 
1. Validating cohorts using a second data source 
2. Reducing the burden of SNOMED code selection 
3. Defining the scope of a DES or diabetes wide repository 

## Key Themes from Clinical Feedback:
### Cohort Validation 
- Type 1 diabetes patients were seen as easier to validate – clinicians noted that insulin prescriptions are a reliable indicator, making pharmacy data a strong secondary source. 
- Type 2 diabetes and HbA1c patients posed more challenges, with cohort accuracy issues often stemming from inconsistent coding. 
The 9 care processes were viewed as a good source of validation, though not without limitations. 
- Emerging data sources like Digital Health Checks and the Health Information Exchange (HIE) were highlighted as promising future assets. 
Clinicians questioned whether a “true” secondary source exists, noting that most rely on GP coding, which can be inconsistent or incomplete. 

### SNOMED Code Complexity 
-	GPs currently use thousands of SNOMED codes, often without clear guidance. Many patients have 50+ codes, while those with only one or two are harder to assess. 
- A definitive DES SNOMED code was seen as valuable, especially for marking attendance, outcomes, and missed appointments (DNAs). 
- However, clinicians noted that unless GPs are financially incentivised, uptake of a new code would be limited, especially since they are paid to complete the 8 care processes, not DES-specific coding. 
- The historic context of codes (e.g. when they were applied) was seen as important for assigning confidence levels. 
- Concerns were raised about non-clinical staff coding and the lack of standardisation across practices, which contributes to inconsistencies. 

### Repository Scope and Integration 
-	There was strong support for a centralised DES repository, with potential to expand to broader diabetes care. 
- Clinicians emphasised the need for better integration between DES and wider diabetes management, noting that screening currently operates in a silo. 
- The transition away from QOF reporting reduced GP engagement, particularly around managing inactive patients. 
- A national decision was recommended for handling non-active patients who haven’t attended their GP in over five years. 
- The date of diagnosis was flagged as a critical data point for understanding patient history and interpreting recent results. 

## Additional Insights 
- HbA1c levels were seen as useful for identifying high-risk patients and understanding engagement. 
- There was a call for more specific patient information, including pregnancy status, language needs, and accessibility requirements. 
- Clinicians suggested sending GPs a confirmation link to verify diabetes status for borderline cases. 
- The London Care Record (based on HIE) was mentioned as a model for enabling read-only access to patient data across health organisations. 

## How It Informed Our Next Steps 
- We are refining our MVP scope based on clinical insight, programme objectives, and commercial and contractual dependencies. 
- We’re assessing the feasibility of a feedback loop that enables bi-directional data flow between DESPs and GPs, supporting better cohort accuracy and care coordination. 
- We’re considering how clearer guidance and standardisation could support improved coding practices at the GP level, reducing variation and enhancing data quality.
