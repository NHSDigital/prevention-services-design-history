Following our design workshop, we developed a set of ideas aimed at improving the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical confidence in the DES cohorting process. These proposals were shaped by user-centred design principles and informed by technical feasibility assessments.

## Proposed ideas to transform the DES cohorting service:
-	Validate DES cohorts using a secondary data source to improve accuracy and reduce reliance on GP-coded entries alone.
-	Simplify SNOMED coding by either introducing a single, definitive code for DES or categorising the existing 2,500+ codes into three confidence levels: Low, Medium, and High.
-	Establish a feedback loop between GPs and DESPs to enable data captured during screening appointments to be ingested back into a central source system. 
-	Increase the frequency of cohort data updates to ensure timely and accurate identification of eligible participants.
-	Create a centralised repository for DES participants, to streamline eligibility tracking. Additionally, consider a future-facing scope that could expand to support broader diabetes care, holistic patient management and broader outcome tracking.

## Additional Insights
-	Gathered the program’s perspective on the value and scope of the repository for DES vs. Diabetes.
-	Collected feedback on the MVP through a voting exercise.

## Outcomes
-	Agreed next step: gather clinical feedback on the DES to-be ideas.
-	Refined understanding of MVP must-haves to inform future scope discussions.
-	Initial assessment of MVP features using T-shirt sizing, based on: technical complexity, user impact and commercial impact.
