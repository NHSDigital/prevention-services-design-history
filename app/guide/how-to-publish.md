title: How to publish a design history entry
---

To publish a design history post, you need to use [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), but we can help you.

To contribute you will need a free GitHub account, and for your account to be added to this project.

Once this is done, these steps:

1. Create a branch. The name of the branch doesn’t matter too much but you could name it after your post title.
2. Add a new markdown file in `app/posts/[service-name]/YYYY/MM/[post-name].md`. It’s often easier to duplicate an existing post. That way, you will have the headers that contain basic information that all posts need.
3. Edit the post with your content - make sure it has a title and date.
4. If you have images, add them to a folder in `app/images/[service-name]/YYYY/MM/[post-name]/`.
5. Open a pull request with your changes and ask for someone to review it. A preview will be available linked from the pull request.
6. Once it’s reviewed, you can merge the pull request and the post will appear live within a minute or so.
