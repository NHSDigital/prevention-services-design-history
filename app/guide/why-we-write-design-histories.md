It's easy to forget whatâ€™s been done, and why.

Design histories help us remember.

They can:

* show us how a service has changed over time
* summarise the outcomes from past user research
* remind why decisions were taken
* give context to new team members
* share design patterns with wider teams in the NHS and government

## Designing in the open

Writing design histories supports [designing in the open](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/design-principles).

It means we are sharing our learning and are transparent in our design decisions.

It is also a way of meeting the NHS Service Standard by [documenting common components and patterns](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/standards-and-technology/service-standard-points/13-use-and-contribute-to-open-standards-common-components-and-patterns) so that others can benefit from our work.
