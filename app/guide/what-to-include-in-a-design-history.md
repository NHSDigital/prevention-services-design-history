Most things you do can be shared.

You could include:

* anything that’s useful to return to later
* new features, iterations of existing ones, findings from user research
* old and new designs, highlighting how they've changed and why
* significant changes
* ideas you’re trying or that haven’t worked
* things that would be useful for others

### What not to include

Do not include personal details of participants or staff.

You don’t need to document every single decision. You will struggle with time to do this and people probably won’t be interested.

Don’t include anything that could be detrimental to a person or the NHS.
