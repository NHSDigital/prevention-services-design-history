Posts within this design history website are written using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple markup language which saves you from having to use HTML.

## Paragraphs

You donâ€™t have to do anything special for paragraphs, except for making sure that there is an empty line between each one.

```md
This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
This sentence will appear next to the previous sentence as single line breaks are ignored.
```

## Headings and sub-headings

For headings, start the line with hash (`#`) characters, followed by a space.

You should use 2 hash characters for a heading (h2), or 3 hash characters for a sub-heading (h3).

Do not using a single hash character for the post title (h1) as this will be generated automatically.

You do not need to create a heading before the introductory paragraph.

```md
This is an introductory paragraph.

## Heading

This is a paragraph.

### Sub-heading

This is a paragraph.
```

## Links

To create links, you have to use a combination of square brackets and rounded brackets.

The square brackets come first, and contain the link text. This must be immediately followed by rounded brackets which contain the URL.

```md
For more information, see [vaccinations on the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/).
```

### Internal links

If you are linking to another post on this design history site, you should not include the full URL, and instead just the part after `https://design-history.prevention-services.nhs.uk`.

This should start with a forward slash (`/`) character:

```md
We previously wrote about [the pilot](/screening-invite/2025/06/invite-pilot-overview/).
```

## Lists

You can add bullet lists by starting each item of the list with a dash (`-`) character followed by a space. Asterisks (`*`) also work.

```md
We have 3 user types:

- administrators
- clinicians
- managers
```

## Quotations

You can add quotations by starting each line of the quote using a greater than (`>`) character followed by a space.

If you are quoting a user taking part in research, they should not be identifiable.

```md
As the NHS vaccination strategy says:

> Vaccination services and activities should be holistic.
>
> Multidisciplinary teams could offer wider health advice and interventions.

```

## Images

To embed an image, use a similar combination of square and rounded brackets as with links, but starting first with a exclamation mark (`!`).

The content within the square brackets is used for alternative text (alt text) for use by screen reading software or if the the images fail to load.

The alt text should not be a simple description of the image ("Screenshot of homepage") but instead contain the key information within the image that is being discussed in your post.

Within the rounded brackets you must include the exact name of the image file, which is case sensitive.

```md
We redesigned the homepage to clearly list the different services within our portfolio:

![Screenshot of a website with the title 'Digital prevention design history'. Beneath this are 3 headings labelled 'Screening', 'Vaccinations' and 'Personalised prevention', and underneath these headings are linked service names in a two column grid.](homepage-redesign.png)
```

### Images with captions

You can also optionally add a caption to an image, which will then appear underneath it on your post.

Unlike the alt text, this should be a short description of what the image is.

The caption can be added within the rounded brackets, after the file name, within double quotes (`"`).

```md
This is our brand:

![Blue rectangle containing 'NHS' as white slanted letters](nhs-logo.png "The NHS logo")
```

## Tables

Tables can be used if you have some simple data or statistics to include.

To add tables, use the pipe (`|`) character to separate the columns and at the start and end of each row.

The table should start with a row that contains headings for each column. After this heading row, add a row using dash (`-`) characters in each column to separate the column headings from the table data.

```md
These are the questions we included in the survey:

| Field                      | Format  | Type     |
| -------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Name                       | Text    | Required |
| Date of birth              | Date    | Required |
| Phone number               | Text    | Optional |
| Consent for future contact | Boolean | Required |
```
