Don’t forget to: 

- draft as you go rather than after you’ve finished 
- add tags so your post can be categorised and found 
- follow the style and structure advice on the [writing for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) guide 
- ask a content designer for support with structuring your doc or for a second pair of eyes (2i) prior to publishing – get help at [#screening-content](https://nhsdigitalcorporate.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C085GLW8Z70) on Slack 

## Title describing the activity

- Keep it succinct (8 words max.) 
- Start with a present participle of a verb (designing, understanding, updating, improving, exploring, etc) 

## (Prologue) Subtitle intro 

- Add a single sentence summary; “We `did a thing` so we could `reason for doing the thing`.” 
- Write this in a way that someone with no prior knowledge of the subject could understand 

## (Act I - setup) Why we did what we did 

- Outline the problem you’re trying to solve and the user story or needs it relates to 
- Describe the nature of the problem (specific finding, recurring issue, etc) 
- Explain how you identified it (data insight, during user research, etc) 
- Use a few bullets to state the hypotheses you wanted to explore 

## (Act II - confrontation) What we did and how we did it 

- Tell the ‘before and after’ story of design developments (“Users couldn’t do something. We made a change so now they can do this...and that.”) 
- Explain how this addresses problems or improves user experience 
- Go into detail, ideally in context with visual aids (screengrabs or recordings) 
    - Avoid including prototype or live service links – these evolve so may not match what people are seeing in the design history 
    - For all media, include descriptive alt-text and captions 
- Describe why key decisions were made and alternatives that were considered 
- Describe any difficulties or complications and how you tacked them 
- If you’re showing more than one design workflow, separate these with the appropriate markdown headings 

## (Act III - resolution) What we learnt 

- Provide details of any testing this design went through 
- Include direct quotes where possible – these are powerful! 
- Connect test outcomes to the hypotheses stated in the “Why we did what we did” section – were the assumptions validated? 

## (Epilogue) What we’re doing next 

- Say what will become of this work (more iterations, more testing, pushing live, etc) 
* Connect this up to other work you’re doing and explain how it fits into bigger plans
