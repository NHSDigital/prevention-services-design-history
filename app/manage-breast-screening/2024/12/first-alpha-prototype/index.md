## Where to begin

Our service will evolve to cover the entire journey of managing a breast screening event. But for a first prototype, we’re starting with the initial part of the journey – managing clinics and interacting with participants.

We’re considering these first designs as items for conversation with our users, rather than things to be fully usability tested.

## Ideas we’ve explored

### Clinic lists

The prototype includes some initial ideas about navigating between simultaneous multiple clinics being run by a breast screening unit, and how they might be filtered by whether they’re open, closed or upcoming.

### Checking-in

We wanted to explore what sort of information might be needed on a clinic list for reception staff to be able to check-in a participant.

### Participant questionnaire

There’s a number of questions a mammographer needs to ask the participant at their appointment – for example, health history and any recent breast symptoms. To help save time at the appointment, we’re exploring the option that some of these could be sent to participants in advance.

For this first prototype, we built these as questions within a mini survey so that we could talk them through with mammographers and find out how they discuss these subjects with participants.

## Research findings

The research went largely positively – users were able to navigate in and between clinics easily and understood how they might open a participant view to make changes.

Where our users seemed more concerned was the time it could take to complete the participant questionnaire – appointments usually last just 5 to 8 minutes. Many of the questions only need detail if the answer is ‘yes’, so we will be exploring how mammographers can add detail where relevant, but not require them to interact with each question where the answer is ‘no’.
