## Vision

The national booking service (NBS) will ensure everyone in England who needs a vaccination can book an appointment securely, quickly and easily

The aim is to make it easier for citizens to find and book appointments.

## Hypothesis

We believe that citizens need the flexibility to book and manage appointments themselves or have someone do it for them.

Therefore, a digital booking system with the ability to search, book, amend, or cancel is required, either directly by the user or a proxy (friend, relative, relative, or contact centre agent)
