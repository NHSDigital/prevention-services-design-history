Our research with National Booking Service (NBS) users had shown that some of our users found the appointment selection process difficult.

Some people struggled to remember which date they had selected, and then found it difficult to remember which time of day they were free.

## The existing screens

Users would forget which date they had previously selected, and find choosing a time range and appointment slot difficult as a result of this

## What we did

We included the date the user had selected for their appointment on the time range and appointment slot screens.

We hypothesised that this would help users remember which date they had chosen, and reduce confusion and difficulties around choosing appointment times.

## Findings

We found that displaying the selected date on the subsequent screens meant that users were less confused when they were selecting their appointment time.

Users were able to see which date they had selected, and this made it easier for them to remember which times they were available on that date, which reduced frustration when choosing an appointment time.
