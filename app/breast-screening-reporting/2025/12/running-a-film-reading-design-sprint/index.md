## What is film reading?

Film reading – looking at x-ray images – is done by radiologists, and is how we identify areas of concern in a mammogram.

Radiologists reading performance is routinely quality assured to ensure accuracy, consistency, and patient safety. The reports also provide film reading performance data to the film readers themselves to help them understand their performance and support improvement where needed.

The Film Reading Quality Assurance report (FRQA) is a set of reports within BSIS that supports the assurance process and helps us understand if our radiographers are detecting cancer at the rate we would expect, and in the way that we would expect.

FRQA is therefore central to our core purpose of detecting cancer, preferably as early as possible.

## Can we move existing FRQA reporting into FDP?

We already know that there are lots of areas for improvement in film reading reporting that will represent a significant step forward for the programme.

But we also must look at something more fundamental - does FDP have what we need in order to host and visualise the report?

The current FRQA report in BSIS contains custom data visualisations that were specially created for this data type. FRQA needs multiple role-based access control views, and uses personally identifiable information. These reports are therefore clinically sensitive, operationally important, and tightly governed.

By focusing on in FRQA we will surface any strategic or technical blockers to delivering a better solution for this report as soon as possible.

As mentioned we have also that the current report in BSIS can be made more useful in future by, for example, producing data to film readers in a more timely way.

In this design sprint, we will also explore how we can go beyond the definition of the FRQA report and support both quality assurance and real-time performance reporting at the same time, using a common solution.

## What our film reading QA design sprint will cover

During the sprint, we will:

- explore how FRQA reports are created and their data requirements
- explore what film reading performance reporting could look like for the new Breast Screening pathway
- consider what better architectural solutions could look like in FDP and otherwise to serve both needs
- produce an options analysis weighing up clinical assurance, governance and technical feasibility
- outline an early roadmap to support the future delivery decisions

Compared to the KC63 design sprint, the aim of this design sprint is not to produce a finished prototype. Instead, it will provide stakeholders with clarity on what different solutions could be, the trade-offs and constraints that exist, and what further work would be required to deliver safe, usable reporting for film readers in future.

We are in the process of doing some pre-work to we can set up the design sprints to be as effective as possible. This means learning more about the current FRQA, including engaging with users. We’re keen to hear from FRQAr users who may struggle to use the FRQA report in BSIS or have ideas about how to view film reading performance going forward.
