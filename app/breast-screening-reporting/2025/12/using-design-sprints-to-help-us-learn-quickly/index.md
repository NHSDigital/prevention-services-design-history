## Introduction

Reporting is a challenge for many of us in Breast Screening – from getting the accurate data we need, compiling it together, before finally interpreting it to inform vital data driven decisions.

As part of our programme of system modernisation that includes replacing NBSS (National Breast Screening System), the Breast Screening Reporting team is evolving current reports with automated, more intuitive dashboards with more timely insights, starting with reports that currently exist in Breast Screening Information System (BSIS) that were built to help quality assure the services.

This entry touches on how the team have approached the problem and the work done so far

## A different approach

One of the ways we can accelerate our work is to run a design sprint. It’s a methodology developed by product teams at Google to help them move forward quickly by validating with experts and users.

We tried this approach earlier in the year with our first BSIS report, KC63, and found that with some adaptation of its original structure, design sprints can be very effective at moving us forward in our uniquely complex and challenging clinical context.

We want to be quick to decide and iterate, and this method echoes the principle of loving the problem, not the solution. We also learned that these design sprints can be difficult to run when we have so many users and stakeholders, so we are ensuring that we are more prepared and notifying others of them ahead of time.

## Why we use design sprints

The time-boxed, structured process of a design sprint brings the right people together to understand a problem, explore options, make a decision, and test it quickly.

As we look at evolving the data and reporting in BSIS, our design sprints will focus on a single BSIS report as a problem space, allowing the team to run an entire discovery and early alpha in as little as one week.

Each sprint brings together:

- key users
- stakeholders
- subject matter experts (SMEs)
- the full team – engineering, product, design, and delivery

This ensures that expertise, data constraints, and delivery risks are considered in every activity.

**The benefits include:**

- Fewer surprises later, as technical, data, and delivery constraints are identified early
- Investing in little time upfront leaves more time later to build, improve or even change the solution if needed
- The whole team getting close to the problem and the users, with team members working together across all activities which creates clarity and focus
- A change from the usual day-to-day rhythm gives the team dedicated time and space to ideate and creates momentum for the quarter

## What we took away from the KC63 design sprint

For our first design sprint in July 2025, we focused on understanding the simplest report in BSIS – KC63. This report compiles coverage data from all breast screening services in England. Coverage helps us understand how well the screening programme is reaching the eligible population and is formally published annually for public accountability.

We explored how KC63 could be improved and delivered in FDP with the underlying question to answer being ‘does FDP’s have the capabilities we need to replace this report?’.

We found that the report in BSIS was not used regularly, it lacked helpful visualisations of the data and must be used in combination with other reports to gain meaningful insights. We have found that this is a theme with a lot of the BSIS reports; that many individual tables could be replaced with fewer, more holistic insights.

By the end of the design sprint we had iterated and validated a prototype dashboard that shows:

- Key metrics together with uptake, coverage, and round length
- Appropriate benchmarking and trend analysis
- The ability to compare regions and Breast Screening Offices (BSOs)
- Infographics, like maps, showing performance at a glance
- Breakdowns by deprivation

We are building the first, very basic version of this dashboard in FDP as Breast Screening Coverage (KC63). This helps us understand how to deliver an early version of the dashboard and the underlying setup needed for the final version.

Next we will look at more complex reports like Film Reading Quality Assurance (FRQA).
