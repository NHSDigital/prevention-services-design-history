## Opportunity

We’re working to make screening easier to understand, easier to access, and easier to manage.
Right now, the experience can feel confusing or disconnected—especially if you’re taking part in more than one screening programme. We’re changing that by:

- Replacing outdated systems that make things harder than they need to be
- Creating one simple, consistent journey—no matter which screening you’re invited to
- Building a service that can adapt as your needs, or the NHS’s needs, change over time

## Hypothesis

We believe that if your screening information is all in one place, you’ll feel more informed, more confident, and more in control of your health.
When you know what to expect—and when—you’re better able to take action at the right time.

## Future vision

We want you to be able to manage your entire screening journey in one place. That means:

- Seeing clearly when and how you joined a screening programme
- Understanding each step along the way
- Being able to view your past screening appointments and results

Everything in one easy-to-use space

## Our starting point

We’re beginning with people invited for routine breast screening. In this first version of the service, you’ll be able to:

- Learn more about your screening and how it works
- Check when your next appointment is due
- View a clear record of your past screening appointments

You’ll be able to do this through a new website called Manage Your Screening—even if you’re not logged in or using the NHS App.

In the future, we’ll also bring this service into the NHS App, so you can choose the way that works best for you.
