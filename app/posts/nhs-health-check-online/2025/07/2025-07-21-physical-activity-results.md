## What is the purpose of the service?

The NHS Health Check is a service for adults aged 40 to 74, designed to assess their risk of developing cardiovascular disease within the next 10 years. Other key health indicators are also included in the results, including – but not limited to – BMI, physical activity assessment, diabetes risk, and cholesterol levels.

‘Get your NHS Health Check online’ aims to provide a convenient digital alternative to the in‑person NHS Health Check.

## Why the move to digital?

Designed to bring convenience and accessibility to preventive care, the digital NHS Health Check empowers users to take charge of their health from the comfort of their own homes – without compromising on quality or accuracy. 

However, as more services transition online, understanding the impact of this shift to digital is crucial. How does the online approach compare to the face‑to‑face check‑up? What challenges exist in ensuring service parity? And how can the NHS continue refining digital health tools to support better outcomes?

## Challenge in this case study

Users receive a physical activity assessment result alongside other key health indicators. In the online NHS Health Check, the algorithm calculates a person's health risk based on specific criteria. However, a limitation arises when assessing physical activity – only four out of the seven mandatory questions contribute to the General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ) score.

In face‑to‑face health checks, healthcare professionals can review and discuss all seven questions, including the three ‘non‑GPPAQ’ ones, allowing for a more holistic assessment and personalised, tailored advice. The challenge in the digital version is ensuring users still receive meaningful insights and guidance despite the more restricted data available for their risk calculation.

## Insights from initial usability testing

Our early user research in private beta highlighted some challenges with initial designs for physical activity results. Some users felt the GPPAQ didn’t capture non‑structured or informal activity, such as gardening or housekeeping, and therefore didn’t allow them to provide an accurate set of responses. They were therefore demotivated or insulted by being labelled ‘inactive’ in results, despite their perceptions of being at least somewhat active. We also observed that some individuals with a physical health condition or limited mobility didn’t perceive the GPPAQ questionnaire, and therefore results, to accurately reflect their reality – users wanted a service that acknowledged their health conditions and physical limitations and included useful information and advice that was aligned to their individual needs.

## What have we done to address the challenge?

We’ve gone through several iterations, each shaped by real feedback from users who challenged our assumptions and helped us build something more inclusive, informative, and supportive. Here’s a look at what changed – and why it matters.

## Starting with what counts

In the early stages of the service, the physical activity questions lacked a clear structure or rationale. This led to confusion – particularly among users who, despite walking for hours each day, were still being labelled as ‘inactive’. It quickly became apparent that the GPPAQ definition of physical activity didn’t align with the lived experiences of many users. For a large number, walking was their primary form of movement, yet the system didn't acknowledge it in a meaningful way.

To address this, we restructured the section into two distinct parts. The first focused on the questions that directly contribute to the user’s GPPAQ score. The second introduced a new concept: “Everyday Movement.” This section was designed to give users greater clarity about why we ask these additional questions and to paint a more holistic picture of their daily activity. It recognised forms of movement that, while not traditionally (by GPPAQ standards) classified as exercise, still mattered deeply to users – and it showed. The feedback was becoming more positive.

## A shift in language and perspective

Some participants were confused or frustrated by the phrase “in the last week,” as their physical activity can vary greatly. We’re now re‑evaluating how we phrase these prompts to better reflect people's typical habits rather than capturing an unrepresentative snapshot.

## Behaviour change done right

Our aim went beyond simply collecting data – we wanted to empower users to take meaningful action. By applying behavioural science principles such as goal setting, practical advice, and breaking tasks into small, achievable steps, we also reshaped how physical activity results were presented. Even though the additional questions didn’t feed directly into the algorithm, we were committed to ensuring users still received personalised, relevant guidance – just as they would in a face‑to‑face consultation.

Participants responded especially well to supportive, realistic advice like “start small and build up,” alongside practical suggestions such as chair‑based exercises or the NHS Strength and Flexibility programme. These recommendations acknowledged and respected their everyday activity levels, rather than holding them to unrealistic standards.

Behind the scenes, the content team developed a feedback matrix tailored to these supplementary questions. This allowed us to provide targeted, helpful feedback – even for criteria outside the algorithm – making the experience more inclusive, human, and action-oriented.

## What our users have to say

When testing the latest iterations of the GPPAQ questions and results sections, users spoke much more positively about the designs than in testing of early iterations. The concept of ‘everyday movement’ was more aligned to the realities of many users in our research than ‘exercise’, and we heard from users that this made the service feel more aligned to their needs and more inclusive overall. We also heard how content that was added to the results screens advising users what to do next, and available resources, was well received  by users – especially by those that were unable to participate in regular structured exercise:

“I like this [physical activity results content], it’s telling me how I can improve, and I already do chair exercises at home… so there’s a lot of stuff I can do at home and build up to 30 minutes or so.” – Female, 47

“So I’m moderately active, and could do more… I like what it says here about the difference it can make to reduce the diseases, that’s nice.” – Male, 62

“Yeah see, it’s included what you can do if you have a disability so that’s good. It’s made it feel less generic and like it’s taking into account my situation so I like that” – Female, 51

## What's next?

As we continue to evolve the Digital Health Check, we’re keeping user voices at the heart of the process. We hope to continue taking steps to move towards a more inclusive personalised approach as we develop our results pages.
