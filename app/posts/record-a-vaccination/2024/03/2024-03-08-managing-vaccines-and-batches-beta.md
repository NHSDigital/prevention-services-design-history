title: Managing vaccines and batches (beta)
date: 2024-03-08

We're close to releasing our minimal viable service into beta with hospital hubs.

To understand if the 'manage vaccines and batches' user journey continues to meet user needs, we prototyped and ran research sessions with 6 hospital hub participants.

Users like system administrators can set up or add vaccines and batches their organisation gives during this journey. This allows vaccinators to view and select the preset vaccines and batches during vaccination recording.

The journey is a simplified iteration of our earlier [managing vaccine designs](/record-a-vaccination/2023/09/managing-vaccines-beta).

## Managing vaccines

The manage vaccines user journey begins at the settings home screen, where users can add vaccines to the sites they plan to give and record vaccinations.

During testing, we observed that all users successfully navigated to and clicked the ‘add vaccines’ call to action button to start the journey.

### Adding vaccines

In one step, users can:

- select a site(s) and then,
- add a vaccine product to the selected site(s)

Once users complete this step, their choices appear in the right-hand ‘shopping cart’. The step can be repeated until the user confirms all of their choices.

### Shopping cart pattern

The shopping cart pattern clearly informs users when they have completed a step and allows them to continue or review their choices before ‘checkout.’

### Users add vaccines to sites

During testing, users struggled to understand whether they should click the ‘add vaccine' or ‘confirm choices’ button first, highlighting the need for clarity.

Some users mentioned their organisations have around 30 sites that stock the same vaccine. We will update our designs to allow users to add vaccines to multiple sites in one step.

### Users review their shopping cart

Users did not immediately notice the basket, suggesting we must draw their attention to it.

### Users check and confirm their selections

From here, users can save and end the journey or add batches if they have received stock.

## Managing batches

### Pattern recognition

We adopted the managing vaccines shopping cart pattern for this journey. Users' interactions showed that they had quickly learned how to add batches to their sites despite the challenges they faced when adding vaccines.

### Users add batches to sites

When entering the two-part COVID-19 batch number, users did not understand why they needed to enter this information and where to find it. They were also unaware they needed to enter the thawed expiry date. We'll iterate the content to clarify this information.

### Users return to the vaccine home screen

We allowed users to view the listed vaccine products their organisation offers, navigate to specific vaccine products, or return to the added vaccines and batches journeys.

### Users navigate to the specific products' home screen

We allowed users to add, edit, or change the status of a batch at the product level.
