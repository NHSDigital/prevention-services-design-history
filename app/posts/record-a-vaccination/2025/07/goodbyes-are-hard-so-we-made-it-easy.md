## Intro

RAVS has a regional interface which has been successful in allowing the 7 NHS Regions control who they want to on board to RAVS and when. It gives them control for their own area and removes a level of admin otherwise taken up by the RAVS team, a win-win.


## Challenge
However, the time has come to allow regions to also off board organisations. The who are no longer part fo the region’s vaccine campaigns for whatever reason: no longer vaccinating on the campaign, closed, changed ownership or other.

It makes sense to therefore allow the regions to say “goodbye” and off-board any organisation they no longer deem part of their region for vaccination campaigns.

The challenge is allowing the organisations enough time to finish everything they were doing. This could be recording any last retrospective records, making edits if needed and any final checks, as they won’t be able to when the account is finally closed.


## Solution

To allow a smooth transition to closure the RAVS regional interface lets regions deactivate organisations, which then gives 90 days, to either change their mind and undo the action or the organisation will become closed after 90 days.

The 90 days of course also allows circa 3 months for the organisation to get things in order as needed. 

Both these elements are clearly displayed in the regional interface in terms of what the regions need to know about deactivation and the email that will be sent to the Lead Administrators at that organisation.

Closed organisations have a separate section with a link at the bottom of the organisations list in the regional interface. This keeps a history of who has been closed and the UI tidy with the more common actions and important page elements sitting above.



## Next
We have demonstrated this new features and will be keeping in touch to monitor not just this feature but their overall use of the regional interface. The more they can do, the less RAVS needs to, which is good news for both parties.
