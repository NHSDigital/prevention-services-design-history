The next challenge for us was to zoom into the cohorting phase of the Diabetic Eye Screening (DES) journey so we could make a start on our remit for Cohort Manager.   

We knew that with contracts of our key stakeholders expiring we didn’t have the time and luxury of doing everything in the right order, but it was important for us to ensure we were solving the right problems at the right time.   

## What we did   

We began a thematic analysis of the pain points in the DES journey and validated these with our stakeholders. We categorised the pain points into 5 themes. This helped us break down the problems into factors that we could influence and address with the products and capabilities that Digital Screening is developing, as well as those beyond the scope of our work. This approach allowed us to stay focused on the user needs and pain points that our cohorting service could address. 

Our Service Design team conducted an exercise to reframe pain points as "How might we" statements. This approach allowed the team to collaboratively brainstorm potential solutions. By transforming problems into design challenges, we encouraged creative thinking and avoided limiting our ideas. Involving a multidisciplinary team ensured that our solutions were practical and realistic, taking into account time constraints as well as technical and cost considerations. 

Next, we conducted a series of democratic voting sessions to prioritise our ideas internally as a team. We then presented our prioritised ideas to the programme stakeholders over a series of playbacks. These sessions were extremely valuable, as the DES stakeholders are closest to the service and are subject matter experts. They enabled us to validate our ideas, stress-test existing concepts, and identify new ideas with an emphasis on co-creation. 

## Outcomes  

- This exercise of reframing our challenges and co-creating ideas with the programme was beneficial in several ways: 

- The process provided us with a shared understanding of the key challenges we need to address, validating our main points and confirming that we were targeting the right problems.  

- It created a space for open discussions, helping us build relationships with stakeholders and understand their hopes and concerns.  

- We identified gaps in our discovery process.  

- Collaborating with stakeholders ensured that we engaged collaboratively rather than simply presenting our ideas.  

- Our key stakeholders facilitated communication with other important stakeholders, bringing us closer to a shared vision for our cohorting service.
