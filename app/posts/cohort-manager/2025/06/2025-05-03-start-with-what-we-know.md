Digital screening teams have set out to work on the digital transformation of national screening programmes. The [review of the breast screening services in 2018](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/764413/independent-breast-screening-review-report.pdf) resulted in breast screening being prioritised for this enormous task. Next in line was the diabetic eye screening (DES) programme; the discovery work for which had been paused in early 2024. Diabetic eye screening is an important test for people with diabetes to check for diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to irreversible sight loss if not detected and treated early. This screening is usually offered for free and is an essential part of diabetes care to help prevent vision loss.

The commercial contracts for cohorting and quality assurance (QA) services with third-party providers for DES expire in 2026, presenting a strong commercial and business case for the digital screening programme to consider DES.  

Team Select is the first team in the value chain for digital screening and is working on the cohort manager product. Cohort manager aims to ensure the right people are selected for invitation to screening.   

## What was the ask?   

As team select is the first team looking at the diabetic eye screening programme, we were tasked with looking at the end-to-end journey of the screening programme and brainstorming on how we can leverage the capabilities we are building in digital screening to help DES.  

The work was led by a user centered design (UCD) squad and supported by a technical architect. A multidisciplinary team with UCD professionals ensured that we championed a user-centred approach to looking at the users’ journey within DES.   

We started with a focus on looking at the entire end-to-end journey for the programme before jumping into studying how the cohorting product by our team would assist in resolving the challenges and pain points of DES.   

## Our approach  

Our approach to this work was to ‘Start with what we know’. Before us, several other teams had done discoveries for DES therefore we used the previous discoveries to take up this task. We reviewed the existing artefacts and documentation to build our understanding so we could make use of the existing wealth of knowledge.   

We reflected on the lessons we had learned from breast screening to identify the gaps in our knowledge and the existing documentation we had.  

We leveraged the expertise of our colleagues working on the digital strategy and policy for DES to understand aspirations and key milestones for the programme.  

As screening programmes have complex journeys with several staff users, public users, legacy systems and processes to capture, we decided to summarise all our learnings visually. We worked on achieving a visual output on Mural to enable others to engage at a high level with what happens today and how tomorrow could potentially look.  

We examined and synthesised the pain points identified in the programme by different users involved. We gathered pain points that had already been identified in the previous discovery, analysed them and prioritised them. After this exercise, we then looked at different products and capabilities available in digital screening and how they could meet these needs.  

## Output 

We produced a high-level artefact of the DES as-is and desired to-be end-to-end screening journey  

We started with bringing together various teams and professions to engage with the artefact so all teams could have a shared understanding of DES and our to-be desired state. Moreover, getting more teams and professions involved meant more perspectives and ideas to examine a possible vision for DES  

The artefact has become a starting point for various outcome teams who can start visualising the end-to-end user journeys, systems and processes and then zoom into their specific service offerings and products.   

We validated the high-level and key pain points with the DES programme to make sure we were on the right track and looking to solve the right problems for the programme.   

Whilst this ask of our team had a tangible output, the outcomes of this work are even more valuable. One of the foremost reflections by Lou Downe in their blog about [‘What is a service?’](https://good.services/blog/what-is-a-service): ‘Just because you don’t provide the whole service, doesn’t mean you’re not responsible for the outcome.’ This exercise brought to the foreground the importance of understanding the whole DES service and not just focusing on the cohorting service we are working on. It also reiterated the role digital teams play by breaking the silos and initiating important conversations.   

## Outcomes 

We saved time and resources by reviewing existing documentation and validating information, needs and pain points. This helped us start the process early and build on what we knew already.   

We looked at the end-to-end journey to understand how our product fits into the wider service, thus being able to consider the impact and value of the proposition of our product on the wider journey. This gave us an opportunity to consider transformations which would have a wide-ranging impact on the service. By understanding the landscape and broader journey, we were able to ensure that service changes would mean more people will get invited for diabetic eye screening, reducing the chance of people losing their sight due to diabetic retinopathy. We learned that it was important to check the integrity of the DES cohort at 2 key stages to help us provide assurance early on, minimising manual tasks and reconciliation efforts.   

Relationships with stakeholders were built on a solid foundation. Rather than having them reiterate what they had already shared with previous teams, we took the initiative to enhance our understanding as much as possible before we went to them with questions. This showed respect for their time and helped to quickly build social capital.  

As we continue our work on DES, the next step for us was to zoom in on cohorting in DES.
