## VSCR vaccination and screening split

The Vaccinations, Screening, and Health Records (VSCR) team began by exploring what a joined-up hub for vaccines and screening could look like in the NHS App. They spoke to people to understand what they would expect and need from each part of the service.

Through this research, it became clear that vaccinations and screening are quite different—both in how people experience them and what they need to manage them. Because of that, the decision was made to separate the two and let each area focus on designing the right solution.

That’s how the Manage Your Screening (MAYS) team was created—to take forward everything learned in that early work, and build a service focused entirely on making the screening experience clearer, simpler, and more joined-up for the people who use it.
