## Key opportunity

Currently the participant experience of screening programmes is fragmented, manual and participants have minimal control over their screening journey.

## Our hypothesis

We believe that by building a Single Source of Truth for screening data we will be able to deliver a solution that gives participants the right information, at moments that matter, in an experience that empowers them to take preventative action to improve their health.

## Future vision

A user would be able to:

- View screening record and next due date
- View results
- Self-refer
- Order test kit
- Book appointments
- Personalised screening content

## Web first approach

Start build for the authenticated users that don't necessarily have access to the app and add functionality as a standalone website before integrating with the app. This is because there will be a proportion of the population (particularly underserved groups) that wonâ€™t or don't use the NHS App.
