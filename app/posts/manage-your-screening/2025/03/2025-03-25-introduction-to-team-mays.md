## Opportunity

Mays is working to deliver:

Reduced dependencies on legacy tech stacks

Consistent participant experiences across all screening pathways (Participant Manager)

An end-to-end orchestration process for screening programmes that can dynamically adapt to business needs (Pathway Co-ordinator)

## Hypothesis

We believe that by building a Single Source of Truth for screening data we will deliver a solution that gives participants the right information, at moments that matter, in an experience that empowers them to take preventative action to improve their health.

## Future vision

MAYs will give Participants a consistent screening experience and access to screening information all in one place:

- Pathway enrolment

- Pathway episode information

- Pathway screening record

## Initial approach

By leveraging business events to drive screening processes MAYS will ensure a more patient-centric screening infrastructure, capable of evolving to meet future needs.

In the first instance, we will allow eligible participants within routine breast screening to see:

- relevant screening pathway content,

- episode information: next due date

- screening records for routine screening appointments

We will do this using a standalone ‘Manage Your Screening’ website (to enable unauthenticated users to access certain functionality).

We will later integrate with the NHS App as a 3rd party web integration (just like the NBS booking integration used in vaccinations currently).
