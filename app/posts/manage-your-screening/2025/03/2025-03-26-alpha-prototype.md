## Initial scope

Our first alpha prototype will explore an NHS login journey. Weâ€™ve designed this for P9 authentication. We want to see that you can:

- log into the service
- see when you are next due for screening
- find information about the screening you will take part in
- see records of your past screening appointments

## Prototype

We have used the NHS.UK prototype kit to design a high-fidelity prototype for this testing round:
