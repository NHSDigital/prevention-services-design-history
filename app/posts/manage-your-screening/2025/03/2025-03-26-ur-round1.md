## VSCR context

The VSCR (Vaccinations, screening, health records) team previously explored the opportunity of a vaccine and screening hub within the NHS App. As part of this work they had designed a prototype, conducted usability testing and ran an A/B test.

Due to technical constraints the prototype was however limited to static content only - a simple summary paragraph describing the screening process and a link out to NHS.uk web pages for more information.

Building on the findings from this work Team MAYS have recognised the importance of personalising the experience so that users can see their records, eligibility and appointment information to empower them.

## MAYS research round 1:

Research focus:

These interviews were aimed at uncovering deeper insights into user needs, pain points, and workflows that may not have been fully captured in the previous research.

The primary focus of the research was to understand why users would engage with the NHS app/web interface for screening. Specifically, we explored factors that might deter users from engaging with the platform, which features they find appealing or useful, and how the app’s functionalities align with their needs and expectations. We also sought general feedback on the user experience and users’ impressions of the proposed prototype.

## Methodology:

Generative interviews were conducted for 1 hour via Microsoft Teams to gain in-depth insights into participants' experiences with breast, bowel, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and cervical screening programmes. The focus was to uncover participants' needs, challenges, and behaviours throughout their screening journey.

### Prototype screens (breast screening example):

### Who we spoke to:

Our participants were limited to a small group most of whom had a relatively good health literacy

## Research findings

Two Distinct User Types:

- Information Seekers: Users engage with the app to learn about screenings but don’t manage appointments.

- Health Journey Managers: Users actively use the app to manage appointments, track results, and organise their healthcare.

Screening Information and Eligibility:

- Users want clear indicators of which screenings they are eligible for based on age and individual circumstances.

- Personalised, age-related messaging is highly valued.

- Some users are concerned about potentially missing screenings they are eligible for.

Results and Records Management:

- Users want direct access to screening results within the app, presented in simple, clear language.

- Full screening history should be easily accessible, and guidance is needed for missing or incorrect results.

User Experience and Trust:

- High trust in the NHS App and its information, with users seeking a more integrated, seamless healthcare management experience.

- Some users have accessibility needs, such as larger screens or text options.

- Users want clear pathways for resolving errors or issues with their records.
