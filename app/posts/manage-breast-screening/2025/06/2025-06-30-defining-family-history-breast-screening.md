People with a first degree relative (such as a mother, sister or daughter) previously diagnosed with breast cancer, have a statistically higher chance of developing breast cancer themselves.

If this family history is identified by a medical professional, the woman will be referred to Family History Breast Screening via their GP, where they will be offered an annual screening mammogram to help early identification of breast cancer. Currently, there is a reliance on women to identify themselves as having a family history via their GP, so there is a risk that some cases may be missed. 

More details on the definition of family history can be found on the [Cancer Research UK website](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer/risks-causes/family-history-and-inherited-genes). 

## Running of the service 

Unlike the [National Breast Screening (BSP) programme](https://www.gov.uk/health-and-social-care/population-screening-programmes-breast) (also known as 'routine' or 'population' screening), family history screening is not a nationally commissioned program. It is run and funded by local trusts, so there is no national oversight or standards for this service. Trusts generally follow the BSP guidelines and NICE family history guidelines, but they are free to run the service as they choose, leading to some variance in local processes and software systems used. 

## Risk types 

There are two risk types covered by family history screening: 

### Moderate risk 

- Have an **increased** risk of developing breast cancer due to their family history
- Have an annual screening mammogram
- Are screened between the ages of 40 to 50 years 

### High risk 

- Have a **high** risk of developing breast cancer due to their family history 
- Have an annual screening mammogram  
- Are screened between the ages of 40 to 60 years 

For reference, there are other breast cancer risk types: 

- **Population risk** – participants aged 50 to 70 who have a population risk of developing breast cancer are screened once every 3 years  
- [**Very high risk**](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-breast-screening-high-risk-women/breast-screening-for-women-with-a-higher-risk-of-breast-cancer) – Participants who have a significant risk of developing breast cancer due to their family history, or an inherited or faulty gene 
- **Surveillance** – Participants who have recently been diagnosed and recovered from breast cancer are screened annually for 5 years (or to the age of 50, if they are under 45) to check for signs of the disease returning.  

## User research 

To understand more about how family history screening differs from routine screening, we have conducted an analysis of previous user research and visited two additional family history breast screening clinics, for a deeper dive into the clinical journey which we are currently re-designing. 

### Round 1 

This research was based on: 

- 6 site visits 
- 11 site phone calls interviews 
- SME validation

## What did we learn? 

### Referral to family history  

Participants can be identified as having a family history of breast cancer via the following methods: 

- Their GP
- Visit to a symptomatic breast clinic (for example, they had a breast cancer symptom investigated at a breast clinic)
- Through a family member being diagnosed with breast cancer 

Once the family history has been identified they are directed to their GP, who will arrange a referral to a Family history clinic or Genetics department, where a risk assessment will be performed. 

### Risk assessment 

Following a referral to family history, the participant will be sent a questionnaire to complete (paper or digital). Completed questionnaires are sent back to the family history clinic where the answers are entered into a risk assessment tool (eg. CanRisk). There are several different risk calculation tools available which units may choose to use. This tool will calculate the participant’s risk and the family history clinic will refer them to a screening protocol (such as moderate risk or high risk). 

Those with a very strong family history, or other risk factors, may be sent for genetic testing for the BRCA gene. If they have the gene, they will be referred for [very high risk screening](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-breast-screening-high-risk-women/breast-screening-for-women-with-a-higher-risk-of-breast-cancer). 

### Cohort management 

Once identified as moderate or high risk, various process steps may occur, depending on local service differences.

#### Participants over 40 years 

If the participant is 40 years or over, they are referred to their local family history breast screening office, where a local administrator will enter the details from the paper letter or referral card, into the local Radiology Information System (RIS).

The system used for managing family history screening participants tends to be the same local system that is used for symptomatic screening – this is mainly for ease, as they are not able to use the National Breast Screening System (NBSS) for this cohort. Some sites are also using a local version of NBSS (NBSS2) to manage family history screening. 

They then create a cohort, or list of participants to be screened, on the local RIS, which is used to track and assign annual screening appointments. The referral letter or card may also be uploaded to the system for reference. 

#### Participants under 40 years 

For family history screening participants who are under 40 years, different process steps may occur: 

- Their local GP stores their referral and forwards this to family history screening when they are approaching 40 years 
- The referral letters (or cards) are stored in the screening office, and once a month, the admin checks if any participants are approaching 40 years  
- The participant is asked to return to their GP when they approach 40 and ask to be referred to screening 

### Booking appointments 

The local admin checks the family history screening list (held in the local RIS), and possibly a paper folder of participants under 40, once per month to see if any of the cohort will be coming due for their annual screening appointment. If so, they start assigning appointments (one-by-one, in the RIS) usually 6 weeks ahead of a scheduled clinic. 

Appointment letters are often manually created and sent out as the local RIS is not set up with automated screening letter templates. 

### Screening clinics 

The family history screening clinics seem to happen in 2 ways: 

- **Stand-alone clinics** – for example, run once per month, containing only family history screening participants 
- **Alongside symptomatic clinics** – as these clinics run regularly and patients are often added at the last minute anyway, it is easy for clinics to slot family history screening appointments in. Symptomatic clinics also use the same local RIS for recording appointment data so it's probably easier for them to run these appointments concurrently. 

### Screening appointments 

Overall, the screening appointment seems to be the same as the routine screening appointment. The same steps and actions are performed, the key difference being the screening appointment frequency (annually versus 3 years for routine) and the system used to record appointment data (local RIS for family history, NBSS or paper for routine).  

The only difference we noted was that in some units they may meet with a family history nurse prior to the screening appointment to discuss changes in their health or family history. In most units this has been removed as it was deemed unnecessary as the participant should speak with the family history clinic in case of any changes. 

We have also found that some radiographers do not ask participants about symptoms in family history screening as they feel participants are more educated on symptoms and when to visit the GP about concerns with their breasts.  There is already a heightened anxiety at appointments due to the higher risk for these women, so radiographers may be reluctant to raise the topic of symptoms. 

### Triple assessment and MDM 

The triple assessment and MDM (multi-disciplinary medical meeting for participants who had a biopsy), processes seem to be identical to what we understand of routine screening. 

The image reading process is also the same, with the only difference being the system used to manage the process (the local RIS instead of NBSS and paper). 

## Genetics and family history involvement in screening 

The involvement of genetics and family history in the screening of moderate and high-risk participants is mainly at the beginning of their pathway. Once they have completed the risk assessment, the screening office manages the participant through the screening process (a family history admin role, within the BSO, manages the admin process). 

At most units we spoke with, genetics and family history aren't informed of appointment attendance or screening outcomes. They only become involved again if the participant is referred back to them (for changes or concerns with their health or family history) via the GP. 

## Key differences: Family history screening vs routine screening 

- **Commissioning** - Family history screening is run by local trusts, not a national program 
- **Screening frequency** - Family history participants are screened annually, whilst routine are screened once every 3 years 
- **Systems used** - Family history use local radiology systems (for example EPIC, CRIS or NBSS2) to manage the process 
- **Less paper heavy** – Local radiology systems tend to be more modern than the legacy NBSS system used in routine screening, so the process tends to be much less paper heavy 
- **Cohorting** – Family history participants are managed locally at each separate trust or screening office 
- **Breast density** – Some radiologists are performing breast density assessments during image reading to assess if participants are still on the correct screening pathway. Women with dense breasts are more likely to develop breast cancer, more likely to be recalled for further tests and it is more likely that a cancer can be missed in a dense breast, so more precaution is taken. For example, if breast density is high in a moderate risk participant (screened 40 to 50 years) and they are approaching 50 years, a local decision may be made to continue screening them annually as their individual risk may be deemed higher. 
- **Behavioural** – Family history screening participants may experience and exhibit heightened anxiety at the screening appointment as they are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer 
- **Monitoring and governance** – Because the service is commissioned locally and managed across various systems, there is a lack of performance monitoring and governance 

## Pain points 

Here are the key pain points we have uncovered during our deep dive into Family history screening: 

- **Risk tools** – Different trusts and sites use different risk tools to calculate the risk of breast cancer, which can provide differing outcomes 
- **Cohorts** – Stored locally, sometimes only on paper. This data then has to be manually uploaded to the local RIS. They rely on an administrator to remember to check who is coming due for screening each month and remember to manually book those appointments in. For those under 40 years, the burden may be placed on the participants themselves to remember to get themselves referred to screening (via their GP). 
- **Losing participants** – Because cohorts are managed locally, there is a risk that if a participant moves out of that area, they will effectively be ‘lost’ as it relies on the participant to get re-referred to a new screening office (via the GP) 
- **Manual referrals** – Referrals to family history screening must currently be a physical artefact (such as a card or letter) as a qualified clinician must sign-off the radiation exposure (due to [IRMA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ionising-radiation-medical-exposure-regulations-2017-guidance) requirements) for each yearly mammogram. In the National BSP, this happens automatically as it has been built into the requirements of the service. 
- **Manual letters** – Local radiology systems often do not have letter templates setup for family history screening (they are not designed for this process and often not prioritised). So admin staff have to create each letter manually, having to double check names, addresses and outcomes, for accuracy. 
- **Dual invites** – When family history screening participants approach 50 years, they are automatically invited to the routine screening program. This causes confusion for participants and can mean they attend the wrong appointment or cancel their family history screening accidentally. There is currently no way to manage this overlap on current systems. 
- **Inappropriate invitations** – Participants being invited to screening when they have a cancer diagnosis causing distress to themselves and family members. Some admins are manually checking this information for each participant prior to sending out invitations, as current systems do not cross-check this information. 
- **Local systems** – Staff feel they at the mercy of the local radiology system, in that a system which was not designed for screening has been shoe-horned into the process and it shows. For example, on EPIC significant cancer symptoms cannot be flagged to image readers, screening letters are not automated, and EPIC does not support a second read queue. 
- **No link between family history diagnosis and screening** – Family history diagnosis and screening have very little interaction once the referral for screening has taken place. If a participant has an update to their family history or if they are diagnosed with cancer, this information is not automatically shared but relies on the participant to visit their GP to ask for a referral to Family history for a re-evaluation. 
- **Manual breast density readings** – Some units are carrying out manual breast density assessments due to lack of functionality in their current mammogram machines (there are systems on the market which can automate this reading).
