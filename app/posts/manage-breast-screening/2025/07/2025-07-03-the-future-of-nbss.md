## The future of NBSS

NBSS has been successfully used in breast screening offices (BSOs) for more than 20 years.

As part of digital screening’s long-term plans, we’re building a new, modern, digital service for breast screening that will deliver new ways to manage the participant and patient pathways. This will deliver the end‑to‑end journey – encompassing appointments, managing mammograms, image readings, and the recording of results.

This service will replace NBSS.

NBSS will continue to exist to support the transition to the new service. Once this transition is complete, NBSS will be retired within England.

We know that each BSO has a unique set up. This means each BSO will be guided and supported through this period, with a detailed, bespoke plan.

We will start working with some BSOs to test our new service from the autumn.
The new service will be built using modern technology, enable better integration of data and be designed to meet the needs of both participants and BSOs.

## Next steps

There will be opportunities to help inform the development of the new service and we’re now looking to start conversations with BSOs who are interested in being ‘early adopters’. Please get in touch via <a href="mailto:england.digitalscreening@nhs.net">england.digitalscreening@nhs.net</a> if you are interested.

We’ll keep you updated on progress as the service develops. If you have questions in the meantime, please send them to <a href="mailto:england.digitalscreening@nhs.net">england.digitalscreening@nhs.net</a>.
