## Overview of HPV Self-Sampling

### The difference between HPV Self-Sampling and Cervical Screening

[Cervical screening](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cervical-screening/) detects types of human papillomavirus (HPV) which can cause cells in the cervix to become abnormal. Removing these abnormal cells can prevent cervical cancer developing.​

Cervical screening is where a clinician collects a sample of **cervical cells**, which is sent to the lab and first tested for HPV. ​

- If HPV is **not found**, no further tests are conducted on the sample, and the participant is invited for cervical screening in 3-5 years time.​

- If HPV is **found**, the cervical sample will be tested for abnormal cells.​

In our service design, HPV self-sampling is an **at-home test** to check for the presence of HPV. The participant collects a sample of **vaginal cells**, via a swab and it is sent for analysis of HPV. ​It is not a requirement for the participant to try and reach their cervix.

- If HPV is **not found**, no further tests are conducted on the sample, and the participant is invited for cervical screening in 3-years time. ​

- If HPV is **found**, the participant will be advised to have a traditional cervical screening, where a clinician will collect a sample of cervical cells to be retested for HPV and abnormal cells ​

HPV self-sampling is **not an alternative** to cervical screening and a clinician taken sample is prefered. However, self-sampling provides an indication of whether the participant is at higher risk of developing abnormal cells which may encourage reluctant participants to attend. ​

### YouScreen pilot overview

> *"YouScreen demonstrated that for GPs, being able to offer self-sampling to under-screened women when they attend for other appointments is a pragmatic way to deliver cervical screening to those at risk"* - [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/self-sampling-hpv-kits-could-screen-an-extra-million-people-for-cervical-cancer)

After the success of the YouScreen pilot in London that enabled people to complete HPV self-testing at home, the NHS wants to scale this service nationally and initially use it to address some of the barriers that non-responders have about cervical screening.​

- The YouScreen trial offered 31,000 HPV self-sampling kits in 133 GP practices across North London from Jan 2021- Nov 2021

- These were offered to women with a cervix, between 25-64 who were at least 6 months overdue for their screening

- Those invited YouScreen kits were offered in two different ways: direct posting of kits or opportunistically at GP practice​

- Self-samples were returned from:​
  - 65.5% (6061/9248) who accepted an opportunistically offered kit ​
  - 12.9% (2777/ 17,604) directly-mailed kits​

- The self-sampling intervention resulted in a 22% increase in non-attenders screened per month​

​
NHS London team are due to restart this pilot in summer 2025, trialing the opportunistic offering with a larger cohort across London practices. Their kit will be used in a clinical setting.

#### First iteration of design

In the first iteration, we explored:
- Different ways we can write the invitation to the service, looking at the barriers, myths and misconceptions people have about HPV and cervical screening​
- We looked at all the channels we can use to send the invitations out: App message, SMS, email and letter. We are also collaborating with the CSMS Notify UCD team as they are conducting research into the digitalisation of cervical screening invitation, reminder and result letters.
- The flow of questions and branching in the journey (happy and unhappy paths, NHS App focused)​
- Patterns for verifying someone's address, asking for a new address, confirmation pages​
- Brainstormed the name of the programme and the service (public facing)
- Brainstormed all the content we may have to write for this service

#### Unmoderated research study - February 2025

In this study, we tested 2 journeys: 
1. One that started with an NHS App message, that would then take the user to a mobile browser view of an NHS.UK website with the ordering journey

2. One that started with an email, in a desktop client, that would then take the user to a web browser view of an NHS.UK website with the ordering journey

The invitation message and the start page had different content so we could test which version addresses the needs of users better.

![](Slide29.jpg)

**Design findings and decisions made based on the unmoderated research findings:**

1. There needs to be content about the age eligibility to ensure people of their own eligibility.
2. The invitation message needs to clearly address why a person has been invited. Futher research is needed to better understand how to make the invite more personalised so that the "why" is clearer and what specific content is needed to reinforce that "why" behind they have been invited. 
3. If technically feasible, we should display the registerd address from PDS we have on the user. Most participants felt that the NHS should have their addresss on file so they do not have to re-enter this information. It was also not clear that they can choose **any** address, even one that is not their place of residence. For those that were clearer on the fact they could enter an alternative address, they thought this would be updating their address on the system too. Content to making these aspects more explicit will be needed.
4. Explore including an order reference number and the address of delivery on the confirmation page as that matches the user's mental models better. Futher content and usability testing on the confirmation page, notifications and specific updates on this will be needed to get the balance between the right content on sceen and which pieces of information users prefer to follow and which channels. 
5. Signpost to traditional cervical screening as an option that is still available to them. This seems to comfort people and to assure them that the NHS is not taking that service away from them.
6. Clearer content around results. Further testing will be needed to get the balance of how much information users will find helpful in regards to how long different parts of the process take such as the swabbing, how long it usually takes a kit to arrive to the lab and in particular results, how long it takes to receive them and how will they receive them.





#### Pop-up research study - March 2025

With this round of research, we focused solely on Invitation content, to better understand which content users engage with and why.  ​

**Research aims:​**

- To better understand user needs for an invitation to take part in HPV self-sampling​
- To engage with a more diverse participant pool, including non-responders to cervical screening and understand preferences on being invited to take part in HPV self-sampling.​

**Hypotheses:​**

Research conducted by the CSMS team showed users better engaged with invitations via SMS in comparison to other invite content options, trusting the tone and links over those in email invite.​

Based on this our hypotheses for this round of research were:​

- Including specific information on cervical screening overdue status will mean users are more likely to continue with the journey as they will feel a greater sense of trust that the NHS knows their medical history, and the invite is for them. ​
- Adding specific content on how the self-sampling kit works and that it does not involve reaching the cervix will mean greater uptake of as users will feel reassured this is something they are able to do themselves.​

**What did we test:​**

- Version 1 of NHS App message invite

- Version 2 of NHS App message invite

- Email invite

- SMS invite

![](messagestested.png)

**Design findings and decisions made based on the unmoderated research findings:**

1. There are a few content decisions we had made that tested well.

![](testedwell.png)

2. Participants did not initially understand how HPV fits into traditional cervical screening. Using the non-abbreviated human papillomavirus first gives people a better sense of what HPV is, especially when followed up with further info about being overdue for traditional cervical screening as this makes the link between the two stronger.​
3. There is a need for supporting content to help drive home what HPV is and why it is being tested for. This could be supported by a visual diagram for people who learn in different ways.
4. Some aspects of the invitation and next steps of the process are not clear. Although there is content on how results will arrive (by post) in the email invite it would be better placed in a 'how it works' section so users are more aware of what to expect.  
5. Having access to previous screening would allow users a greater sense of confidence in the fact they are 'overdue' allowing them to trust their invite. ​
6. Users with limited internet access or low digital confidence would benefit from accessing kits in locations like pharmacies or sexual health clinics. This will also allow the option to see the kit before deciding whether to use it.
7. Time-limited participants like to know as much as possible upfront. Having key information in the invite about how the process works, and if there is anything they need to do to prepare, as this will help participants understand what is needed from them. For participants with English as a second language there were specific questions about what was needed ahead of taking part.​
8. Having information in an easily readable format that can be skimmed for key information is particularly useful for users with dyslexia.
9. There was still confusion around how the self-sample works. Clearly outlining how HPV Self-Sampling works and that there is not a need to touch the cervix may help those who are worried. 
10. For some, there were questions on how to tell if the invitation they were receiving was trustworthy and truly from the NHS.​ There were also mention of feeling the invite did not seem personal enough and would then cause doubt in whether this was truly for them.
11. Many participants said they would be happy to click a link in a text message, however, if the link needed to be copy and pasted – they would be less likely to engage with it.
12. A forewarning of the invite would be useful for participants who felt the invite was out of the blue and would help with trust – this could act as a sort of GP endorsement which we know works well in bowel screening, creating more trust of links. 

**What's next:**

- Iterate content to better align with user needs and ensure clarity. Insights from the research have guided refinements in language, structure, and tone to improve understanding and engagement.​
- Conduct content concept testing to assess how users respond to different messaging approaches​
- Highlight testing to identify which parts of the content are most effective and engaging.​
- A/B testing on invite content to determine which version drives higher participation and resonates best with users.​
- Accessibility testing, to better understand how longer content performs

**Considerations:**

- On the 21st March, a decision to use the NHS App as the front door for the service. This means we have to rework our user journeys and flows to identify all the scenarios involving the NHS App on web and mobile. 
- Pre-election period between 10th April - 2nd May will delay the next usability testing.
- Our team is currently in the process of moving from NHS App governance to a Digital Screeing governance.
