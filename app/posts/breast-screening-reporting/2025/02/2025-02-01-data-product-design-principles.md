There can be a perception that data is somehow independent of its users and if they just see some numbers that’s enough. Our research into data needs showed us that not all users can use what they are given, and therefore that rolling out a product or platform is not the same as adoption among users.

## What we found

In Breast Screening Offices (BSOs) we saw that some data was:

- difficult to access due to problematic logins, for example
- not specific enough to them to be useful
- difficult to use due to the complexity of the tool
- communicated using language and concepts users didn’t always understand
- did not contain all the data needed to answer their questions

In a busy work context these can act as big barriers to valuable data.

In addition to data in tools and platforms there are issues with accessing data in their own system, the National Breast Screening System (NBSS) such as:

- specialised skills are needed to get data out using a second system
- often when data is extracted, BSO admin staff users spend time manually ‘wrangling’ data before it is usable

## What we did

This evidence suggested we need some design principles to ‘keep us honest’ into the future and ensure that we are always meeting the needs of users, not just supplying the right numbers. Users must be able to easily access, understand and act on the data they need.

The draft of design principles below was inspired by NHS design principles and adapted for data users in breast screening.

1. Be relevant and useful
   Understand what data I need to answer my question
2. Keep it simple
   Don’t overload me with options and possibilities in a tool I may be unfamiliar with; I am busy. Help me focus on what’s relevant to my question
3. Make it easy to access
   Logins and permissions can be a barrier in busy environments. I may only need data infrequently logins can expire.
4. Make it easy to understand
   I may not be expert in understanding data or statistics. I should not need special training. Avoid jargon.
5. Don’t make me do work for the data I need
   Data should work hard for me
6. Add value and insight
   Highlight where I need to pay attention; help me find patterns; join data sets for me that help me answer a question](data-product-design-principles.png)

## What’s next

As we continue our work we will refer to these principles to ensure the NHS gets the full value from the data we make available.
