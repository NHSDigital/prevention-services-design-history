Hello! We’ve undergone a mild rebrand. We are now known as the Weight Management team, under Personalised Prevention Services.

Prior to this we were the Personalised Prevention Platform (PPP). A lot of our underlying thinking still stands. Thus:

* Our thin steel thread is an end-to-end prevention journey for weight management.
* We want people feeling supported to make healthier choices that stick.

Our [previous post](/personalised-prevention-platform/2025/04/onboarding-users/) talked about how we've been exploring how we introduce our service to users, and find out a bit about them, through an “onboarding” process.

In this post I’m going to talk about the next stage: recommending next steps.

## Why we did what we did

Our target group of users [is er, dammit]

Everyone in our user research has been aware that they could be doing more to maintain their health.

However people are unaware of the range of places they could get help from – from self-directed apps to in-person programmes to regular community events.

Our [proposition / reckon etc] is that by presenting useful and relevant options irrespective of funding bodies(?) people can be encouraged to take up [activities].

We also [reckon] that if we can find a way to follow up and check in with people, we increase their chances of success

## What we did and how we did it

Service listing and filtering story (2 or 3 iterations?)
- understanding of the zoom in and out
- seeing what people made of the offering
IMAGE - iterations L to R

Service display story (2 or 3 iterations?)
- From blocking to allowing
- Information and jazz hands - imagery and logos etc
- The right level of info - what's pragmatic and possible vs the ultimate ideal
IMAGE - iterations L to R

Opting into checking in
- People want robot seals
IMAGE - iterations L to R

(Act III - resolution) What we learnt

Since discovery[LINKY], we've proved that recommending a blend of national and local services has real value to people.
"National" and "local" is a false organisational distinction - people are interested in Active 10 and they are also interested in the local Parkrun or free online workouts. Where the thing “comes from” is largely irrelevant.
We genuinely had people ask if things were real, and then make notes to look them up afterwards.
We cannot reliably get a user to commit to a recommendation in the moment
- enough info at granular level to make that decision
- the nature of deciding to do a thing may well mean stewing on it for a bit
- blocking the user's journey towards an outcome in order to get a declaration of intent is simply an interaction antipattern - it's only us that needs this, not the user

(Epilogue) What we’re doing next

- Latest work is around "the very first check in"
- Jumping the gap between presenting the options and figuring out if something's being done
