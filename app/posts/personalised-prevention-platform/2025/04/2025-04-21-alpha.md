## Intro or scene setting

The personalised prevention platform (PPP) team have moved into an alpha phase!

      <p>Alpha is where you try out different solutions to the problems you learnt about during discovery.</p>

Towards this end, we’ve completed our first round of prototyping and user research, an exploration into ideas around ‘onboarding’.

To be clear, in alpha we’re building prototypes to explore further and test our hypotheses. Some elements of these prototypes may make it past alpha, and some are deliberate provocations as opposed to attempts at solutions.

## What we did

The things we aimed to explore were:

- users’ understanding of the proposition
- assumptions about consent and data sharing across the system
- the need for information and guidance balanced against service finding
- how to supply information and guidance as one element of a continuous transaction
- system generated priorities versus a user’s priorities
- barriers &mdash; the things that get in the way of making lifestyle changes
- preferences &mdash; the things that make services more appealing
- what sort of services might be returned after onboarding

We did this by creating a mock journey that represented only the initial stages of our (WIP) service blueprint:

- entry points
- starting to interact with a PPP
- confirming and giving information

We also made the following assumptions:

- our chosen scenario starts as a high height-to-waist ratio
- users are already registered with NHS login
- the platform has access to user information held with ‘the NHS’

Our prototypes are built in code (html, css, and javascript only when needed) in order to give users hi(gh?)-fidelity and ‘real feeling’ stuff [omg rewrite]. Working in code means we can iterate and edit extremely quickly. Each prototype gets a few rounds of crit from the whole team. Er, maybe this is a waste of space.

We ran 6 interview sessions with people from our initial target [audience?population?er?]

## Exploring with users / how it went / or something

As an example entry point we used results from the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/health-assessment-tools/calculate-your-waist-to-height-ratio">calculate your waist to height ratio</a> tool. This represented one potential route (amongst many) into the platform.

Any findings?
