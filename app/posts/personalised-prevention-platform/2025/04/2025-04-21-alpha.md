## Intro or scene setting

The personalised prevention platform (PPP) team have moved into an alpha phase!

We’ve completed our first round of prototyping and user research, an exploration into ideas around ‘onboarding’.

We’re building prototypes to explore further and test our hypotheses.

Some parts of these prototypes could make it into a real product, and some elements are designed purely to provoke conversation in research sessions.

## What we did

We aimed to explore users’:

- understanding of what our potential proposition might be
- assumptions about consent and sharing their information across services
- needs for information and guidance balanced against service finding, and how to supply it within an ongoing transaction
- personal priorities versus what we (the system) are telling them
- barriers &mdash; the things that get in the way of making lifestyle changes
- preferences &mdash; the things that make services more appealing
- expectations of what that might be returned as results after going through the process

To help us explore these topics, we built a mock journey that represented just the initial stages a potential journey:

- entry points
- starting to interact with a PPP
- confirming and giving information

We also made the following assumptions:

- our scenario starts as a high height-to-waist ratio
- users are already registered and logged in

Our prototypes are built in code (html, css, and javascript only when needed) in order to give users hi(gh?)-fidelity and ‘real feeling’ stuff [omg rewrite]. Working in code means we can iterate and edit extremely quickly. Each prototype gets a few rounds of crit from the whole team. Er, maybe this is a waste of space.

We ran 6 interview sessions with people from our initial target [audience?population?er?]

## Exploring the prototype with users

### Entry point into the platform

As an example entry point we’ve used results from the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/health-assessment-tools/calculate-your-waist-to-height-ratio">calculate your waist to height ratio</a> tool. This represents one potential route (amongst many) into the platform.

Any findings?

### Start page

After using the call to action, the user then hits a fairly traditional start page pattern. It’s a bit personalised in that it offers examples that make sense for a journey coming from the waist to height ratio results.

Any findings?

We then show a login spinner and a 2 second redirect. We do this to reinforce the illusion that the user has, at some unspecified point, already logged in. This allows us to avoid protracted discussion along the lines of ‘how could it know that?’ in the sessions.

Any findings?

### Do you want know more about the benefits of reducing your waist size and getting to a healthier weight?

The next part of the prototype is aimed at gaining insights and prompting discussion about the _relative_ value of information and guidance.

We do this by asking a simple question: do you want know more about the benefits of reducing your waist size and getting to a healthier weight?

We’re offering to ‘send you some guidance’, and giving the user the option of saying yes or no.

### Can we use these details about you?

Using a fairly realistic barrier, we explore users’ assumptions and expectations about consent and data sharing across the system. Our page presents a forced consent to use a basic set of details in the platform.

Any findings?

### Changes you want to make to stay healthy

A simple way to explore personal priorities versus what we (the system) are saying is to allow people to choose. We display recommended changes based on the user’s journey (in this case height-to-waist-ratio related), but offer more.

Potentially, from this point onwards, a platform could be starting to build up a profile in the background of a person and their goals.

Any findings?

### What do you want to do first?

How do people feel about selecting one priority to tackle first?

As part of onboarding, it’s often [better] to design for as little friction as possible, reducing complexity. A platform could retain all selected goals in the background, but take the user through an initial journey with a single goal.

Any findings?

### What do you find hard about making healthy changes?

Both desk research [hat tip to Southwark?] and our discovery probes noted that asking people what might get in the way brought them much more on board. People often know what they _should_ be doing, and reasonably enough can be put off by being given the same advice repeatedly [our cohort?] something something demotivating.

A platform that takes into account people’s barriers as far as possible when recommending services would be another way to reduce the friction and pain points currently experienced by users. Less friction means less drain on the  motivation to act to change stuff [write betterer]

Something we wanted to test in this example was how people react to only having a fixed amount of barriers to choose from, and why they might be being asked about them at all.

Any findings?

[did any user mention the list being incomplete]

### Preferences

It’s fair to assume that gathering a user’s preferences will allow us to better match them to potentially helpful services.

Conceptually by using ‘facts’ about someone (for example their age, height and weight, and home postcode), we can match a set of services that a person will be _eligible_ for.

Gathering preferences then allows us to reorder or reduce the service selection further. [reducing friction]

Our prototype asks a simple series of questions without branching or logic, to understand how adding preferences changes a user’s understanding or expectations of what will be delivered to them [I cant write today]

### Find services based on what you’ve told us

In a fairly standard pattern we then play back what the user has told us.

![Alt](16@2x.png)

1. Playing back all the user’s goals to them could be a negative moment of overwhelm reducing motivation

---

### Finding services

We end on a loading spinner. This bookends the prospective onboarding process, and allows us to find out

what users expect to happen now
what kind of services they expect to be returned
whether the original impetus has been retained [this is not clear]
