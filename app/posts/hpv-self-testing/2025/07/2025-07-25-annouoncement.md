## Announcement
 
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) made an official announcement on the offering of self-sampling (self-testing) for human papillomavirus (HPV) to under-screened people eligible for the NHS Cervical Screening Programme in England, where service commissioners think it would be a helpful addition to the programme. The HPV self-testing option will be offered to under-screened people alongside the offer of clinician-collected sampling by a nurse or doctor. In early 2026, the NHS will begin offering HPV self-testing kits for cervical screening to women and people with a cervix who are under-screened.

Participation in cervical screening has declined in recent years in the UK. Evidence suggests HPV self-sampling can be an effective and acceptable way to improve participation among people who never or rarely attend. It may also help to reduce health inequalities.

It is important to note at this stage that the UK NSC is only recommending the offer of a self-sampling option to the under-screened. Committee members agreed that this option is better than no test for those who currently do not attend their screening appointments.

### What this means for us

For the past 10 months, the team has been working dilligently on a Discovery, Alpha phase and looking to move into a Private Beta phase by end of the year. We are on track to moving from design to refinement and implementation. We will continue to work at pace, and looking forward to the January 2026 release.

## Service name change

Following the announcemenet, the HPV Self-sampling team changed their name to **HPV Self-testing**. This naming change was confirmed with our senior programme stakeholders. It is based on the research conducted with participants of the public: self-testing resonates better with participants, as it sounds more familiar to them and less 'clinical'. Self-testing has been used in other at-home tests, including during COVID-19, hence the familiarity.
