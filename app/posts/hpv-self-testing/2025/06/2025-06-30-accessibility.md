The HPV self-testing team is aiming to deliver a trusted, reliable and accessible service which allows eligible individuals to order an HPV test, self-sample, return their kit and receive a result, with clear information on next steps. The HPV self-testing service is not a simple at-home testing project. We want to purposely aim this service at a very diverse group of users that are currently not engaged with the cervical screening programme.

**4.5 million people with a cervix** are not responding to traditional screening invitations. Barriers include embarrassment, trauma, time, access, and misinformation.​ This represents a major public health gap, with preventable outcomes if addressed, as HPV is the virus that causes 99% of cervical cancers.

Our service design is complex as it combines both digital and offline services that have to collaborate seamlessly for a good user experience. 

## Our target group

- Non-responders with a cervix aged 30–64 who are overdue for cervical screening.​
- Cohorts will be broken down by riskiest age band to target those at highest risk first.
- The cohort is made of complex and under-represented demographics. Each person that is a non-responder will have their own reasons for not attending their cervical screening. In our User Group Segmentation Matrix - built through secondary and primary research - we have explored these groups and the most common barriers.

**We recognise that not every barrier to uptaking cervical screening can be solved by our service, however we have highlighted where we see an opportunity to encourage uptake and awareness.**

The sub-groups we have identified, that also inform why accessibility is key for the successful delivery of the project:

- People with disabilities: visual impairments, hearing/speech impairments, mobility (fine and gross motor skills) impairments, cognitive impairments
- LGBTQ+: Trans men, non-binary identification, lesbian community
- Marginalised and minoritised communities: ethnic minorities, deprived areas, heavy cultural/religious influenced communities
- People at peri/post-menopause 
- People with history of abuse
- People with medical trauma 
- Digital avoiders or no easy access to data/wifi/accessing digital services

> In the UK, 1 in 5 people is disabled. This can equate to more than [16 million](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9602/) people with disabilities; and these are only the ones that have officially registered their disability and attached it to their personal record. This means that [32% of households in England](https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/https:/business.scope.org.uk/article/accessibility-and-disability-facts-and-figure) have at least 1 disabled person, and [20% of the UK population (or 13 million people)](https://www.tpximpact.com/knowledge-hub/insights/what-is-assistive-technology) use assistive technology. People may not have a choice when using a public sector website or mobile app, so it’s important they work for everyone. The people who need them the most are often the people who find them hardest to use.


## Challenges and what we did to overcome them

Our multi-disciplinary team had various levels of experience and expertise in accessibility. To ensure that our team has a solid understanding of why we must build an accessible service and how we are doing that, the UCD team first ran an Accessibility intro session on a Team Day. We then ran two workshops, one in person in the Canary Wharf office and one online for those that couldn't join in person.

The purpose of the workshops was to:
1. Create a common understanding and empathy for people with disabilities and why accessibility in HPV self-testing is critical.

2. Go through each of the service design phases and brainstorm accessibility considerations for users with visual, hearing and speech, mobility and cognitive disabilities.

We utilised the COM-B model for behavioural change in the past, and brought up the definition of 'disabilities'.

3. Identify what we need to do in design, development, test and product to ensure our service will be made accessible from day 1. This helped ensure that everyone is aligned and aware of what each discipline is going to work on throughout the design and delivery.

Lastly, we created an Accessibility Strategy document on Confluence, that describes:

1. The project brief and our target group
- Project Aim
- Problem Statement
- What we're delivering
- Defining our target sub-groups

2. Key accessibility objectives for our project
3. Responsibilities by discipline
- UCD team
- Product and delivery 
- Business analysis (BA)
- Development
- Quality assurance (QA): Mobile requirements, web Requirements, automated testing, manual testing

4. Success Metrics and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

5. Accessibility workshops
6. Additional training and resources



This document was then reviewed by the wider team and now represents our committment and process to delivering an accessible service. We are committed to building and maintaining digital products that are accessible to everyone, regardless of ability. 

Accessibility is not a one-time task but an ongoing responsibility. Our long-term vision is to embed inclusive design and accessibility into every stage of our product lifecycle — from planning and design to development, testing, and beyond. 

We aim to not only meet recognised standards such as WCAG 2.2 but to exceed them where possible, by engaging with diverse users, improving continuously through feedback, and fostering a culture of accessibility across our teams.
