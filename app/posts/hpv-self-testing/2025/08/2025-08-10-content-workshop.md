On 31st July 2025, our team ran an **online** content workshop with our product and clinical senior stakeholders in Cervical Screening, the Comms and Engagement Team and colleagues from the Screening UCD team. 

The aim of the workshop was to conduct a clinical and product review of the content proposed for the digital invitations, ordering journey screens and order confirmation content. We also wanted to take our stakeholders through the proposed comms logic and flows for HPV self-testing, as we had a few concerns and recommendations based on our user testing or best practice patterns.

We found the best method to get all of our key stakeholders in the same 'room' is to hold this workshop. The engagement turned out great and we managed to move through our agenda at pace, and even sign-off content that can be passed onto BA refinement and development. 

**Workshop duration:** 3 hours, with a 15 minute break
**Tools used:** Mural and Teams
**Facilitators**: UCD lead and Content Designer

## Workshop structure

The agenda we designed was:

1. Welcome & overview (10 mins)
- Brief intro and objectives
- Quick reminder on house rules / how to provide feedback / ways of working for the session etc
- Run-through of the research and clinical reviews done thus far

2. Content review/sign-off part 1 (75 mins)
Content that went through research and/or clinical/comms reviews
Includes: app invitation, SMS invitation, email invitation, start page authenticated, start page unauthenticated, select address question, add temporary address screens, check your answers, order confirmation page, confirmation email

4. Thanks and next steps (10 mins)

### What went well

- We managed to cover a lot of ground in the 3 hours. The agenda was structured well and the participants were engaged throughout. 
- The 15 minute break was a great decision to break up the incoming fatigue of sitting in front of your computer for hours straight.
- Really good feedback from the participants, that liked how the workshop was facilitated and how the content was presented to them.
- We signed-off content that can be passed onto BA refinement and development, keeping to our very tight timelines.
- We sent an email the day after the workshop to keep momentum going and keep the stakeholders engaged.

### Points of improvement for next time

- Given more time, we can present our design decisions with direct research insights or user quotes in the workshop. This would help give more credibility or understanding of certain decisions we made.
- Ideally, organise the workshop in-person given stakeholder availability, as the physical space can be better utilised for printing out content, posters, and keeping people up and moving.

## What's next

We have taken the feedback from our stakeholders, and our content designer worked on making updates to the designs. We have reviewed the updates with the Content design lead on Screening, our wider product team and got an additional sign-off via email from our stakeholders. These screens have now been passed onto implementation.
