> The UKNSC is consulting on introducing self sampling for cervical screening.

**In parallel to this consultation we are running a discovery and alpha phase, to prepare for potential implementation in future. This post summarises what the design and research team worked on between November 2024 to May 2025.**


## Overview of project

### About cervical screening today

[Cervical screening](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cervical-screening/) detects types of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause cells in the cervix to become abnormal. Removing these abnormal cells can prevent cervical cancer from developing.

Cervical screening is where a clinician collects a sample of **cervical cells**, which is sent to the lab and first tested for HPV.  

- If HPV is **not found**, no further tests are conducted on the sample, and the participant is invited for cervical screening in 3 to 5 years time.  
- If HPV is **found**, the cervical sample will be tested for abnormal cells.

### How does HPV self-testing fit within the Cervical Screening Programme

A pilot study, titled YouScreen, demonstrated that for GPs, being able to offer self-testing to under-screened women when they attend for other appointments is a pragmatic way to deliver cervical screening to those at risk.

The UKNSC is currently considering self-testing kits as an option for those who do not engage in the Cervical Screening Programme. 

Planning is already underway to ensure that, if the UKNSC makes a recommendation and it is approved by government and funded, the NHS will be ready to implement it as part of its plan to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040. 


### Our service design

As part of our planning, we have been looking at how the service could be designed, should it be approved by the Government.   

We are building a service in alpha phase that will allow NHS App users to order an HPV self-testing kit to an address of their choosing.  

### Timelines

This is subject to change based on UKNSC decisions and dependencies on procurement of the kit provider, lab logistics and technical development.
