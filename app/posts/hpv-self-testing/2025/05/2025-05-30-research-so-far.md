> The UKNSC is consulting on introducing self sampling for cervical screening. Find out more: [UK NSC consults on offering HPV self-sampling option to under-screened people in cervical screening programme – UK National Screening Committee.](https://nationalscreening.blog.gov.uk/2024/12/04/uk-nsc-consults-on-offering-hpv-self-sampling-option-to-under-screened-people-in-cervical-screening-programme/)

**In parallel to this consultation we are running a discovery and alpha phase, to prepare for potential implementation in future. This post summarises what the design and research team worked on between November 2024 to May 2025.**

### Research done until March 2025

- 1 Qualtrics surveys sent out to NHS App panel 

     - Aim: To understand user needs surrounding HPV self-testing and how personalisation within the NHS App, could be used 
     - 240 participant responses  

- 1 Qualtrics survey sent out to Lived Experience panel and Citizens Panel 

     - Aim: To gather more information on how much users understand about HPV in the context of cervical screening, preferences for receiving invitations and messages about the service and explore user motivations 
     - 391 participant responses 

- 1 unmoderated research study with 32 participants 

- 1 pop-up research study with 27 participants across 5 locations in Leeds  

In April 2025 we had to take a break from research as local elections were happening.


### First iteration of design 

In the first iteration, we explored: 

- Different ways we can write the invitation to the service, looking at the barriers, myths and misconceptions people have about HPV and cervical screening  

- We looked at all the channels we can use to send invitations out: App message, SMS, email and letter. We are also collaborating with the Cervical Screening Management System (CSMS) Design team as they are conducting research into the digitalisation of cervical screening invitation, reminder, and result letters. 

- The flow of questions and branching in the journey as well as service error messages 

- Patterns for verifying someone's address, asking for a new address, confirmation pages  

- Brainstormed the name of the service (public facing) 

- Brainstormed all the content we may have to write for this service


We conducted a **series of workshops** and other service design activities, such as:

- Internal service design workshop 
- Notifications and messaging workshop 
- Defining the service design phases with V&S stakeholders 
- Service design x technical considerations working sessions​ 
- Clinical considerations with NHS App and Screening clinical teams 
- Content strategy workshop with V&S stakeholders, NHS App and NHS.UK stakeholders
- London Opportunistic Offering team collaboration session 

We created a number of **service design artefacts**:

- Extensive secondary research pack​
- Market research and benchmarking​
- User demographics matrix​
- Hypotheses and risky assumptions documentation​
- Service blueprints​ for the as-is service, future service and wider screening context
- Experience Based Maps with OKRs​
- Process flows and high-level user flows​
- Unhappy paths flows​
- COM-B model for behavioural change strategy



### Unmoderated research study - February 2025 

In this study, we tested 2 journeys:  

1. One that started with an NHS App message, that would then take the user to a mobile browser view of an NHS.UK website with the ordering journey 

2. One that started with an email, in a desktop client, that would then take the user to a web browser view of an NHS.UK website with the ordering journey 

The invitation message and the start page had different content so we could test which version addresses the needs of users better. 

### Pop-up research study - March 2025 

With this round of research, we focused solely on invitation content, to better understand which content users engage with and why.    

#### Research aims

- To better understand user needs for an invitation to take part in HPV self-testing  

- To engage with a more diverse participant pool, including non-responders to cervical screening and understand preferences on being invited to take part in HPV self-testing.  

#### Hypotheses

Research conducted by the CSMS Design team showed users better engaged with invitations via SMS in comparison to other invite content options, trusting the tone and links over those in email invite.  

Based on this our hypotheses for this round of research were:  

- Including specific information on cervical screening overdue status will mean users are more likely to continue with the journey as they will feel a greater sense of trust that the NHS knows their medical history, and the invitation is for them.  

- Adding specific content on how the self-testing kit works and that it does not involve reaching the cervix will mean greater uptake as users will feel reassured this is something they are able to do themselves.  


### Design findings and decisions

1. There are a few content decisions we made that tested well. 

2. Participants did not initially understand how HPV is linked to cervical cancer. Using the non-abbreviated human papillomavirus first gives people a better sense of what HPV is, especially when followed up with further info about being overdue for traditional cervical screening as this makes the link between the two stronger.  

3. There is a need for supporting content to help drive home what HPV is and what it is being tested for. This could be supported by a visual diagram for people who learn in different ways. 

4. Some aspects of the invitation and the next steps of the process are not clear. Although there is content on how results will arrive (by app message or paper letter) in the email invite, it would be better placed in a 'how it works' section, so users are more aware of what to expect.   

5. Including previous screening history in invites would allow users a greater sense of confidence in the fact they are 'overdue' allowing them to trust their invite.  

6. Users with limited internet access or low digital confidence would benefit from accessing kits in locations like pharmacies or sexual health clinics. This will also allow the option to see the kit before deciding whether to use it. 

7. Time-limited participants like to know as much as possible upfront. Having key information in the invitation about how the process works, and if there is anything they need to do to prepare, is key, as this will help participants understand what is needed from them. For participants with English as a second language there were specific questions about what was needed ahead of taking part.  

8. Having information in an easily readable format that can be skimmed for key information is particularly useful for users with dyslexia. 

9. There was still confusion around how the self-sample works. Clearly outlining how HPV self-testing works and that there is not a need to touch the cervix may help those who are worried.  

10. For some, there were questions on how to tell if the invitation they were receiving was trustworthy and truly from the NHS. There was also mention of feeling the invite did not seem personal enough and would then cause doubt in whether this was truly for them. 

11. Many participants said they would be happy to click a link in a text message, however, if the link needed to be copy and pasted – they would be less likely to engage with it. 

12. A forewarning of the invite would be useful for participants who felt the invite was out of the blue and would help with trust – this could act as a sort of GP endorsement which we know works well in bowel screening, creating more trust of links.  

### What's next

- Iterate content to better align with user needs and ensure clarity. Insights from the research have guided refinements in language, structure, and tone to improve understanding and engagement.  

- Conduct content concept testing to assess how users respond to different messaging approaches  

- Highlight testing to identify which parts of the content are most effective and engaging.  

- A/B testing on invite content to determine which version drives higher participation and resonates best with users.  

- Accessibility testing, to better understand how longer content performs
