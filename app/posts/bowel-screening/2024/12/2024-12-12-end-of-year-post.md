This is a high level recap of some of the things that have been going on in the bowel screening space for the past month:

## Notify work

A working group has been set up and will meet every 2 weeks to try and iron out the details of the pilot proposal. Key stakeholders and people from the project team are included, the intention is to gather the right people in one space so that some decisions and progress can be made. Recent discussion points have been:

- **Timescales**
  How long we should wait for a read receipt before sending a physical letter
- **Hypothesis for the pilot**
  What do we think will happen and how might we prove or disprove this
- **Commerical implications**
  Some hubs have existing contracts with postal providers which need to be considered

## Symptomatic discovery

We have re-started discussions with the programme around the symptomatic/surveillance process with the intention of getting the go ahead to carry out a bit of discovery work on this area so we can highlight the pain points and opportunities that we are pretty sure exist.
We have got the green light to carry out a site visit with some hubs in the New year which should be really interesting!

## Roadmap progress

We have been working closely with product to try and piece together a roadmap for Bowel screening utilising various bits of information and research to highlight areas that we can work on and come up with some type of priority that hopefully the programme will agree to. This will hopefully provide us with lots more work for the new year and more opportunities for improvements

## Service-blueprint

Ben (our service designer) has started work on a high level service blueprint for Bowel screening which will help to visualise and communicate the current state of the service to the rest of the team and hopefully will enable us to highlight some more areas for improvement.
