title: "Enabling Joint bookings for up to 2 people"

Based on feedback from NBS public users, and requirements for expansion to the service to drive increased uptake of vaccines, we explored options for enabling booking for 2 people for spring 2025.

## What we did 

We re-visited old design work where joint bookings had previously been looked at, and created a new journey, with consideration given to the eventual need to accommodate further expansion, including:

- group bookings, for up to 5 people
- co-administration of vaccines during joint and group bookings

We created a journey which would allow users to:

- choose between the single and joint booking journey
- easily add extra people to a booking
- choose adjacent appointment slots for each person
- manage each appointment in a single booking independently

We engaged with the dev and test teams on both NBS and Manage Your Appointments (MYA) teams, to ensure the solution would be technically feasible from both teams perspective.


## The design
 
We created a prototype that offered users a choice of whether to book for more than one person at the start of the journey.

**Adding people to a joint booking**

We used an 'add another loop' for adding people to the booking, in anticipation of eventually expanding joint bookings for up to 5 people. The loop ends once the maximum number of people have been added to the booking.

**multiple slot selection**

We allowed users to select a slot, and then showed adjacent slots before and after, based on availability.  

This allows users more flexibility and greater choice, such as choosing adjacent slots that may be in different hours (for example, 1:50pm and 2pm).

**Joint confirmation screen**

We show two reference numbers on the confirmation screen, which the users can use to manage each appointment separately, along with the times for each slot in the booking.

## Findings

The majority of users found booking an appointment for 2 people straightforward.  Most users we spoke to said that being able to book for more than 1 person would make it easier for them to plan and attend their appointments.

Most of the users said they would only book for 2 people, one person said they would want to book for up to 3, as they had older relatives that they have caring responsibilities for.

**Booking for two people**

All users clicked ‘Yes’ without hesitation when asked if they were booking for more than one person.​

The option to book for two people was clear and intuitive, with users finding it easy to understand and navigate.​

Users were able to add a second person to the booking, and understood that they were able to book an appointment for two people once both had been added.

**Slot selection**

Most users found selecting appointment slots straightforward.​ One participant expected to be able to book appointments at different times, and wanted more flexibility.
