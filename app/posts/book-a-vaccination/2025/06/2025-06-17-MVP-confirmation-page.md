We found during research that some users find the end of the booking journey a little sudden. 

They are surprised by seeing the confirmation page, and worry they could've made a mistake when selecting their appointment. 

### What we did 

We hypothesised that adding a ‘check your answers’ page to the journey would reduce worry about mistakes. 

We thought that giving users the opportunity to check their appointment selection before confirming would help avoid any surprise or anxiety at the end of the journey. 

**Initial design**

This design tested well with users, and they appreciated being able to check their booking before confirming. 

After discussion with our team it became clear that they wouldn’t be able to implement a full working version of this page this year, due to other items on our roadmap being a higher priority. 

Our product manager asked us to consider an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of this page, to still meet the underlying need, without having to delay adding the screen. 

**The MVP check your answers page** 

After discussion with the team around the technical requirements for allowing users to go back and change their appointment, we designed a new version of the page. 

We tested this screen as part of the proxy booking journey (allowing users to book for another person)

We also changed the order, so that this page would appear immediately after the user selects their appointment slot.   

When the user selects their appointment slot, NBS locks the slot for 5 minutes.  Placing this page at the end of the journey would introduce a risk that the user would not be able to select a new slot before the 5 minutes expired, which meant that they could lose their slot if they couldn’t find a suitable alternative. 

 

### Findings 

All participants appreciated the screen, saying it helped them clearly review their booking before confirming.  

Five out of six participants expected the ‘Change my appointment’ button to take them directly to the date and time selection as that was what they were most likely to change 

One participant suggested the system could prompt users to specify what they want to change - such as the location, date, or time to make the process more intuitive. 

One participant said they wouldn’t be sure which vaccine had been booked (COVID-19 or flu) and said it would be helpful if this were included in the summary. 

 

### Future considerations 

We’ve iterated the design by directing the ‘change my appointment’ button to the date selection page, and adding the vaccine type as suggested during research. 

We intend to iterate this page further by:  

- introducing change links on each question 
- allowing users to change more than just their appointment
- moving the screen back to the end of the journey
