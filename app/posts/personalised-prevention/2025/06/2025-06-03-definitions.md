These working definitions aim to give people working on personalised prevention services a shared understanding of the language they’re using internally.

## Prevention

Any work or activity we do to stop someone getting ill with a named clinical condition, or someone living with a named condition worsening.

## Clinical treatment versus lifestyle and behaviour change

### Clinical treatment

The examination and treatment of patients and ill people by a medical professional.

Clinical treatment services are specifically provided by medical professionals.

A clinical treatment service the Personalised Prevention Platform recommends might be a self‑referral to Talking Therapies.

### Lifestyle and behaviour change

The way someone lives.

A lifestyle and behaviour change service recommended to a user might be a service we think could help stop you getting ill, for example WeightWatchers or a yoga class.

Lifestyle and behaviour change services are not required to be delivered by medical professionals.

## Assisted and unassisted services

### Assisted services

Any service where there’s real-time human help, for example a taught Zumba class or a stop-smoking app with a coach.

### Unassisted services

Any service that can be used in a self-service way, for example by:
* reading a stop-smoking book
* using a gym alone (not doing a class or getting personal training)
* using an app with an AI coach

## Behaviour change support

### NHS only

Services presenting as “from the NHS”, for example Couch to 5k or Better Health services. These services might be funded centrally by organisations like NHSE or DHSC.

### NHS-supported services

Services with any funding from DHSC, NHSE or an organisation like a charity.

A service that’s delivered in partnership with a charity like Mind or anything with an NHS logo on it, for example the Richmond Wellbeing Service.

### Wider healthcare prevention services

Anything else not funded by NHS bodies, such as services provided by:
* councils, for example leisure centres, gyms or wellness hubs
* the third sector, for example by a community group or voluntary organisation
* private organisations, for example, Better Health recommends WeightWatchers and Joe Wicks
