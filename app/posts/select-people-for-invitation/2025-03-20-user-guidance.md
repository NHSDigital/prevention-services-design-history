SPI is built to be intuitive and easy to navigate.  

We continually test how users interact with the tool to identify where additional support is needed.  

Guidance was created throughout the SPI build and this is regularly updated as we make improvements and add new features to SPI. This ensures users feel confident when creating or editing campaigns. If a user encounters a problem, they can easily self-serve by accessing step-by-step guidance.  

During testing, we assess whether users can: 

- Identify help content 
- Understand the information 
- Follow the instructions to complete tasks 
- Navigate to the help content 
- Successfully complete tasks

Previously, campaigns were created using JSON configuration files, which used technical language. While much of this terminology was carried over to the SPI UI, we're simplifying the language and adding helpful support explanations for technical terms.  

To support users in independently creating campaigns, we've explored several support content methods:  

## Inline support 
We provide inline guidance directly within the UI, to assist users when there are technical terms, or complex tasks and features. This support appears alongside the task, so users can easily access help without having to leave SPI.

### Inline support content example

## Long-form guidance 
We've developed detailed guidance documentation so novice users can self-serve. This step-by-step content walks users through the campaign creation process, offering additional instructions to help them complete each task. Currently hosted in Confluence and linked from SPI, this documentation will be moved to a more accessible location in the future.

### Long form guidance example

To ensure version control and support clinical risk assessments, we maintain a document management section. This tracks updates and provides an audit trail of changes over time. 

## Future considerations 
We're exploring the possibility of moving the long-form guidance from Confluence directly into SPI. Each page would feature a small help circle (shown below), which, when clicked, will open a pop-up with task-specific guidance relevant to the user's current step in the journey. This will allow new and novice users to access additional support as they create a campaign, all without leaving the UI. We will test this feature with both novice and expert users to ensure its effectiveness and accessibility.
