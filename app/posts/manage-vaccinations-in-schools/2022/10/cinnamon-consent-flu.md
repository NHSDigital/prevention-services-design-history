Cinnamon is a digital [‘Immunisation e-Consent’ tool](https://www.cinnamondigitalapplications.co.uk/eConsent).

Screenshots show the journey parents take through Cinnamon when they are giving consent for their school-aged child to have a flu vaccine.

## Letter sent via school

Parents enter the website from a link emailed to them in a PDF, sent by the school.

There was no clear call to action in the email itself.

The formatting of the PDF letter made it difficult to read.

A second guidance PDF tries to give help on how to use the service, but its distorted screenshots and red arrows make the process look more complicated than it is.

The PDF letter had the following text:

> The Influenza nasal spray vaccination is offered annually as part of the national programme for vaccination of children and young people. This academic year the vaccine will be offered to children in all year groups from Reception through to Year 6.
>
> The nasal spray flu vaccine is safe and effective in helping to protect children against flu.
>
> Flu is caused by the influenza virus, which children can catch and spread easily. It can be a very unpleasant illness for children, which can lead to serious problems, such as bronchitis and pneumonia.
>
> Vaccinating them also protects others who are vulnerable to flu, such as babies and older people.
>
> The vaccination is given as a simple, quick and painless spray into each nostril.
>
> Contained within this letter are some frequently asked questions and useful information about the vaccine, and the virus it protects against.
>
> Further information is also available on the NHS Choices website www.nhs.uk.
>
> Please take this opportunity to check that your child’s routine vaccinations are up to date. You can check this with your GP Practice. If you have any questions, you can also contact the Immunisation Service or your School Nurse.
