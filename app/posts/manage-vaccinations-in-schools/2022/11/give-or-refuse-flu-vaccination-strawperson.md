Based on an analysis of existing consent tools we determined parents and guardians would need to:

- tell us, or otherwise confirm, which school their child was at
- give details about their child or children
- give details about themselves, including contact details and their relationship to the child
- record consent, and if no consent is given, give a reason
- answer medical questions specific to the vaccine to make sure it is safe for the child to receive the vaccine at school
- confirm their choice and information given
- be easily able to tell the health team if anything changes (for example they get the vaccine elsewhere)
- have details about when and where the vaccination will happen

This service will need to be used by parents of homeschooled children. This is not currently designed.

## Service name

We started with:

> Give consent for a vaccination

This became vaccine specific:

> Give consent for a flu vaccination

If you do not intend to give consent, there isn’t a reason to visit a ‘Give consent’ service. We want to encourage people who do not give consent to tell us and tell us why. We made this choice more explicit in the service name:

> Give or refuse consent for a flu vaccination

## Confirming their child’s school

We saw that current consent tools have tricky ways of confirming which school a child is at. They used:

- a postcode or name lookup (postcode being the school’s postcode, not where you live)
- a code, emailed separately, to identify the school

We suggest that the link each parent receives will be unique to their school. It might also be unique to them and their child. This means the parent need only confirm the school shown – they don’t need to find it or find and copy a code.

## Adult details

We ask for:

- name
- relationship to child
- telephone number
- email address

We might want to confirm their email address somehow.

### Relationship to child

We’ve gone with:

- Parent
- Guardian
- Carer
- Other

We need to validate this list.

Given different rules around parental consent for mother and father, we might need to explicitly ask which they are.

## Child details

We ask for:

- name
- preferred name
- date of birth
- sex (not gender)
- GP they are registered with
- NHS number

### Preferred name

A child may go by a middle name or abbreviated name, or something else. We expect there is a need for this information to help nurses build a rapport with each child during the vaccination event.

### Sex and gender

We don’t know what the need is for this information, we have assumed that sex is the appropriate thing to ask for in a medical scenario.

We need to find out:

- if this question can be removed
- if it’s vaccine specific and only needed in certain cases
- whether we ask for gender or sex, if required

### GP they are registered with

Not all consent tools ask for this. We need to confirm the need.

It’s not clear how easy it will be for people to find their GP surgery.

It’s also not clear what data we would use, and how we’d structure that list.

We also include two options to help the user:

1. let them continue if they don’t know
2. tell us if they are not registered at all

### NHS number

Not all consent tools ask for this. We need to confirm the need.

It’s not clear how easy it will be for people to give an NHS number.

It might be the case that with the child’s information we can look up and match a child’s details without needing their NHS number. If we do not find a match, we might ask for an NHS number in that situation.

## Vaccine specific journey

Each vaccine journey will need to be specific.

The start page needs to give detail about the vaccine and specific links to more information.

The medical health questions will vary depending on the vaccine.

## Available in other languages

The service must be translatable to other languages, to make it easier for all parents and guardians to give consent.

We need to research which languages would be most helpful.

## NHS App

If consent was somehow made available through the app, we might get some information for free. This might include parent and child details. This could simplify the consent journey, if people can sign in hassle free.
