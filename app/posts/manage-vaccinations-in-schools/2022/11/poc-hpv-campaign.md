The journey for recording an HPV vaccination is very similar to the [flu journey](/manage-vaccinations-in-schools/2022/11/poc-flu-campaign/).

In the HPV case we might want to refer to students rather than children, given their ages.

Students may not have been given consent by their parents, but given their ages, Gillick consent is an option. We know this, but have purposefully left self-consent to later.

## HPV has multiple doses

HPV is a vaccine with two doses, the second coming 6 to 24 months after the first.

We do not know how the point of care system would know about previous HPV vaccinations, but we have assumed that it would.

From this assumption, we can tell the users if the student needs to have their first or second dose.

We play back the current dose:

- on the student details page
- on the vaccine details page
- on the check and confirm answers page

At the moment the prototype defaults to the first dose for everyone.

## HPV vaccine is an injection

We must ask for the vaccination site when someone is vaccinated. We’ve put the most common sites at the top – right arm and left arm.
