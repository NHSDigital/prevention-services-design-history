The 3-in-1 teenage booster and MenACWY vaccinations are given at the same time. We capture consent for both in the same parent journey.

On the day, a child might:

- get both vaccinations
- get just the MenACWY vaccination
- get just the 3-in-1 vaccination
- refuse one or both vaccinations

## Indicating consent

Consent may have been given for one or both of the vaccines. It needs to be clear to the nurses which vaccines they should be giving.

We’re attempting to do this with:

- a warning message if only a single vaccine has consent
- highlighting the vaccine type in the call to action

## Vaccination order

The vaccinations could be given in any order, but we’ve heard that some nurses prefer to give MenACWY first. Children will already have some level of protection against diphtheria, tetanus and polio (3 in 1) from earlier vaccinations. So if they have their first injection but then refuse the second, they have had the most important one.

We ask which vaccine the nurse will be giving first, and put MenACWY first in the list of choices.
