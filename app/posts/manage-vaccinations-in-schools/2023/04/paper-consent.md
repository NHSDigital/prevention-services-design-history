We know some parents and SAIS teams have a need to deal with consent requests offline.

As such, we’ve designed a paper consent form that is as close as possible to the consent journey in the digital service.

Our current thinking is that each form will be customised, with the name of the school and the date of the vaccination session at the top of the form.

## What the form does not include

The form does not include any general information about what the HPV vaccination is for, or when it is usually given. These details will go in a covering letter.

## Refining the form

We did a quick test of the form with family members. One mum thought she had to give all her child’s official names, so we tweaked the wording of the ‘Name’ section to make it clear that we only need first and last names. We also added some more space to allow for longer names.

In our original form, we had a question about communication needs which people could use to indicate whether they were unable to receive particular types of communication.

Choices were:

- I cannot receive voice calls
- I cannot receive text messages

One mum worked in an area with limited mobile coverage, and could only receive texts at certain times of the day. Our question didn’t allow her to add this type of detail, so she was confused about what to put.

We’ve taken the question out for now. We’ll see how it tests with users of the digital service and return to it if we need to.

## Other improvements we need to consider

We need to think about how to make it as easy as possible for users to transfer information from the paper form into the digital service. We have not yet explored the technology that we could use to do this – barcodes and QR codes, for example.

We hope to learn more about offline processes in our upcoming in-person research.
