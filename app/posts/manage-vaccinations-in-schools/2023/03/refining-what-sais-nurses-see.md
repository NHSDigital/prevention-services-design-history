title: Refining what SAIS nurses see

We’ve made a number of changes to the service following feedback from SAIS nurses. Some are minor tweaks; others are significant redesigns and additions.

## Tweaking the dashboard

Some nurses questioned our use of the word ‘campaign’, saying it sounded like a one-off event rather than a routine session, so we’ve changed this to ‘session’.

We also observed some nurses struggling to work out where to record vaccinations, so we’ve simplified the dashboard to make the right link easier to see.

## Redesigning the table view

Once SAIS nurses start recording vaccinations, they get a table view. Our previous designs assumed that:

- they would only need to see a list of children whose parents had given consent to vaccinate
- nurses would use this list primarily to check whether children had been seen or not

Our research showed these assumptions were wrong. Many SAIS teams will see all children who are eligible for vaccinations and try to get consent for them (or assess Gillick competence) on the day. The outcomes that nurses are interested in are also more varied than seen and not seen.

We’ve now redesigned the table view so that nurses can see:

- a list of all children eligible for vaccination
- details of who has and hasn’t received consent (given, refused, unknown)
- a range of outcomes for children (vaccinated, could not vaccinate, no consent, no outcome yet)

The filters on the on the left of the table are now working and allow nurses to filter by:

- year group
- consent status
- outcome status

## Expanding the child information page

Following feedback from nurses, we’ve also added more details to the child information page (this is what nurses see if they click on the name of the child from the table view).

This page now includes:

- a banner showing whether consent has been given, refused or is unknown
- details of who has given consent and what their relationship to the child is
- the child’s address
- a space for nurses to add notes

We added the child’s address because nurses told us they often use this when identifying children – an important part of a vaccination session. They also told us they’d like a space in which to jot down anything that might be relevant to the vaccination, so we’ve put one in. (There’s a separate section for nurses to record notes after they’ve given the vaccination. We need to test what nurses think about these two options.)

## Creating a way for nurses to record consent

We’ve also added a section called ‘Are you attempting to get consent?’. This is because we learned from research that nurses will often contact parents or guardians if they haven’t responded to consent requests, and even if they’ve refused to give consent.

We still need to design the journey nurses will go on if they choose either of the yes options, but we expect it to be similar to the journey a parent would go on if they were giving consent through the service.
