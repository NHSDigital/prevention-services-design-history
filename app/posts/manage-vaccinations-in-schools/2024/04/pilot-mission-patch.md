The mission patch for our pilot features Mavis the polar bear protecting her 2 cubs.

We chose a polar bear as the team’s mascot because:

* they’re big on protecting cubs
* they live in hostile environments
* they’re highly adaptive
* they’re great at conserving energy

That, and everyone on the team seems to love [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/).

To celebrate completion of the pilot, our first mission patch features the northern lights, reflecting the colours of the teams involved with its development, while the 3 stars represent the 3 SAIS teams we piloted with.
