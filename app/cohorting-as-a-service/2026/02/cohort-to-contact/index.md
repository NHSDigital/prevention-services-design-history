title: Cohort to contact in prevention – are we all talking the same language?
description: Shared language for how we identify and contact people eligible for prevention services.

In prevention, a large part of what we do is about directing the right people to the right intervention; alternatively put, ‘cohort to contact’. However, the terminology we use to describe the activities required to do this is inconsistent.

This isn’t surprising, as many of these terms are complex and highly contextual. Meaning can differ:
- across different areas of prevention, for example, the term ‘targeted’ has a unique definition in screening set by the UK National Screening Committee
- between national and local contexts, for example, with the term ‘segmentation’ carrying much more weight for national initiatives with large initial cohorts
- depending on whether a noun or verb is used, for example, ‘targeted’ as mentioned above vs ‘targeting’ in a campaign management context

Why is this important, you might ask? If we’re not speaking the same language, collaboration across prevention becomes much more of a challenge and the risk of duplication and lack of coordination increases.

## What did we do to address this challenge?

We held a workshop to bring together the teams across DPSP who play a role in cohort to contact in prevention. Representatives from Select People for Invitation (SPI), Cohorting as a Service (CaaS), Cohort Manager and VDS Eligibility Data Product attended.

In the workshop we explored and stress‑tested our terminology against what we currently do and what we think the future might look like. It wasn't straightforward.

However, out of this workshop, we’ve come up with a first version of a glossary of terms for cohort to contact in prevention. Will the definitions be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive? Probably not, but we hope they provide a starting point for us to build a shared language and understanding upon.

## Glossary of terms – cohort to contact

### Cohorting

The process of identifying a group of individuals who share specific characteristics (be it demographic and/or clinical) at a set point in time, therefore making them eligible for a particular service. The group identified is often referred to as the ‘denominator cohort’.

### Segmentation

Splitting and labelling a denominator cohort of eligible individuals into smaller groups based upon certain shared characteristics. All segments remain eligible for the core service offering but may be contacted/offered the service in a different way.

### Eligibility criteria

The specific characteristics (demographic and/or clinical) that will be used to determine whether an individual belongs to a denominator cohort and is therefore eligible for a defined service.

### Eligibility status

Whether an individual has the specific characteristics required to be part of a denominator cohort at a set point in time, and therefore whether they are eligible for a particular service. This status is binary but may change over time.

### Manual additions

A way to add individuals to a denominator cohort who meet the eligibility criteria, but who will not be cohorted based on the data held for them, for example, transgender populations for sex‑specific services.

### Risk stratification

Using data and models to put individuals into groups according to their risk of a defined outcome,, for example, cancer diagnosis. These risk groups can form part of the eligibility criteria for a denominator cohort for a particular service and can also determine how they are segmented, for instance to determine how and in what order they are contacted.

### Targeting

Varying the approach to contacting individuals, based upon the segment of the cohort to which they belong, to best achieve the desired outcome of the service, for example, sending invitations to higher‑risk individuals earlier in a campaign.

### Filters

Specific criteria which identify and remove segments of individuals who we do not wish to contact from the denominator cohort, for example, individuals who have already received the service or who are not yet due for the service.

### Personalisation

Tailoring our communications with individuals based on specific characteristics (demographic/clinical/behavioural), for example, adjusting the content, channel, or frequency.

## What’s next?

First and foremost, we want your feedback! We want this to be a ‘living’ glossary and we want to make sure we can build consensus across DPSP.

As we begin to explore what cohort to contact will look like in a local context (vs a national context), we want to ensure these definitions remain sensible

You can expect much more collaboration across DPSP in this space, as we explore what a more joined‑up cohort to contact offer could look like.
