### Supporting users to query, analyse, and interrogate data.

Our initial discovery revealed that in current point-of-care systems, reporting was either too basic or advanced, disempowering users to query, analyse, and interrogate vaccination data. 
 
We also uncovered several major sources of frustration for reporters when running, creating and sharing reports about patient or staff vaccinations across some systems. In addition to taking up users' time, these issues presented data risks. 

>"If I run a report, I get every field. 35 columns, and maybe only want 10. I want to filter out or customise them. Better for data quality and saves deleting what I don’t want. I am running reports daily. There is some useful stuff in there, but I just want control." 

For example, in some or all systems, users: 

- Can only run one report at a time 
- Cannot create custom reports 
- Do not have the ability to save reports 
- Encounter limitations with, or a lack of data visualisation 
- Can only download reports for two-week periods. Longer periods are compiled from multiple two-week extracts. 
- Must reselect the date range repeatedly when running multiple reports. 
- Cannot select what fields they want when downloading data extracts, so they delete unwanted columns before joining them together. 
- Cannot access data before a certain time period and need to make a support call which can take 5 to 7 days. Users would prefer to self-serve if possible. 
- Do not have the ability to download a report covering both COVID and Flu 
- Have no means to check who has access to patient records, or to control access through a read-only account.  
- Cannot easily view records captured by a given vaccinator over a specific time period.  

>"Why is this limiting? I don't understand it. It gives me headaches… A year's worth of reporting when I can only do 2 weeks at a time. This took me hours!" 

### Supporting users to report vaccination event data 

Our prototyping focused on solving some of the problems reporters face and making reporting, analysing data, and sharing reports easier. 

We specifically looked at the following scenarios: 

#### Running and sharing preset reports 

We offered reporters a choice of preset vaccination reports including an option to report on Covid-19 and Flu vaccines together. Reporters could select or deselect subcategories under each preset report to create custom reports (screen one).  

At a later stage in the journey (screen 3) we offered reporters the ability to further refine the selected data through a filter. Users found this very valuable as the reporting needed to reflect the complexity of different vaccination delivery settings.

#### Running multiple reports at the same time 
 
We offered reporters the ability to run and create multiple reports together. Their feedback strongly suggested this would save time and reduce error if the date range was selected across all reports as illustrated in the image below.

#### Previewing selected data

We also offered reporters the ability to preview and filter the data selected in the report. We considered what fields and parameters reporters would need. The preview was met with mixed reviews as some users indicated that they would ultimately download the excel version to interrogate and manipulate data locally, while others would use the filter to do this in the system. 

Reporters also confirmed they would prefer to share the report by email, save it or export as an excel, when running one or multiple reports.

### Meeting user needs 
 
Reporters described the current reporting capabilities within current point-of-care systems as too complex (EMIS) or too simple, and felt our designs presented a good balance to meet their needs.
