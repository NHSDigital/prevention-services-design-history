To design and build a record a vaccination service that works across different healthcare settings, we must meet the needs of various user groups and staff with diverse roles or permissions, like system administrators and vaccinators.  

Throughout our prototyping, we plan to invite research participants from: 

- Community pharmacies   
- GP practices   
- Hospitals (including maternity services) 
- Large vaccination centres   
- Primary care networks  


We'll consider: 

- What vaccine delivery settings do they work in?  
- What point-of-care systems do they currently use?  
- What is the level of their digital literacy?  

The aim is to recruit two users across each setting, ideally, one participant representing maternity services in hospital hubs to get a good mix of users familiar with different point-of-care systems.
