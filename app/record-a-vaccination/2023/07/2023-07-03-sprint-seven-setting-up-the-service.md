### Setting up a point-of-care service

Following our initial sprints investigating how staff manage appointments, vaccine stock and system users — we wanted to explore how new users might navigate the end-to-end journey of handling these tasks.  

For example:  

- The first time a user sets up an organisation, what tasks can they expect to complete and in what order?  
- What level of support might a new user expect from the system during the setup process?  

### Wizard: set up assistant  

We explored how valuable users find a wizard when setting up their organisation and sites for the first time. Wizards allow users to input information in a specific order, with the next steps based on previous inputs. They work well for processes that are performed occasionally.   

### Managing vaccine stock, users and appointments  

Although we tested managing vaccine stock, users and appointments in our previous sprints, we were keen to understand if we needed to refine our designs and what tasks users expected to complete when setting up for the first time (or later).  

**User is prompted by a set-up assistant**

### What we found: 

#### Using the set-up assistant 

Overall, users found the process of using the set-up assistant straightforward, easy to use, and in a logical order. They also valued the ability to skip steps that were not required.  

#### Setting up their organisation and sites 

Users expect: 

- a progressive search when adding their organisation name or sites to the set-up assistant, so as they type, one or more potential matches are found.  
- moreover, they expect to search for an organisation or site’s ODS (Organisation Data Service) code. 
- to import multiple sites from a CSV upload template to save time manually keying in data. 
- the ability to add site types to report where patients have been vaccinated, for example, pop-up clinics. 

#### Adding vaccines and batches 

Users want the ability to: 

- control vaccines and set minimum stock thresholds at the site level (not organisation) 
- add batches during setup or later. Some users add batches in advance, while others do so when they are delivered. 
- scan batches when they have been delivered to avoid keying in information. 

#### Adding users and setting permissions 

Users expect to: 

- add and view users by their registered health care professional role, for example, a nurse or doctor. 
- check the user data they have uploaded is correct. 
- activate a user account on a set date. 
- see basic information about the permissions each role can or can’t do. 

#### Adding appointments 

Users want to: 

- upload appointments through a CSV template, and; 
- import appointments across multiple sites and/or dates in a single upload 
- skip this stage if they do not have any booked appointments to import. 

#### General findings 

Users expect: 

- system feedback to appear at the top of the page so it isn't missed 
- support through onboarding or training with uploading multiple users or appointments, and access to CSV templates before set-up. 
- flexibility to skip certain set-up tasks and return to them later.
