## Helping users to monitor their performance and activity

To support users to monitor their performance and activity, we considered what data they would need to review and any information requests they may need to respond to.

From a user perspective, we considered:

- What's happening in my organisation or site?
- What is going well and what isn’t?
- What mitigating actions do I need to take to prevent issues?

To answer these questions, we mapped out what data users may need to monitor in a dashboard view and developed a prototype that we could test.

## What we found

Overall, users found the dashboard valuable for auditing purposes and exceeded the capabilities of existing systems with poor functionality. As a result, it would help users identify issues in real-time and address them quickly instead of finding out later through reporting.

However, to improve the dashboard, users expect to monitor:

- Typically, over a period of seven days (one week)
- Patient cohorts, for example, the immunosuppressed and housebound patients
- Performance of their organisation’s sites side-by-side.
- Staff vaccinations along with patient vaccinations
- Why vaccines are not given to patients because they are refused or ineligible
- Vaccine doses administered, and active batches remaining for booked appointments
- A registered healthcare professional's role
- Vaccine wastage at the site level and the reason behind this
- User's edits to understand whether they needed retraining
- Staff’s mandatory training status and when this was due to expire
- Activity from the previous year compared to the current year

We'll iterate our prototypes based on this feedback.
