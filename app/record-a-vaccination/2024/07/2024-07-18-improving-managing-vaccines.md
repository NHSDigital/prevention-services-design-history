Following RAVS pilot feedback, users reported struggling to add new vaccines and batches, identifying a need to improve the process. 

The initial design split the process into 2 steps:

1. Add the vaccine product 
2. Add a batch including a batch number and its expiry date

In practice, users were unlikely to use the 2-step process and poorly understood it Similarly, users did not need to add multiple vaccine products to a 'basket' and found it unclear.

As such, we designed a new user journey based on existing NHS designs and patterns, which allowed users to add a vaccine product and the batch details together, before finally submitting this information. 

In the coming months, we'll review how users find this new version to see if it meets their needs.
